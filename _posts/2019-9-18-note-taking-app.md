### Taking Notes

It's a good idea to take notes in class. It's even better to have typed notes. Notes on paper are trapped there. They cannot be searched.

There's a new player on the block called Notion. <a href="https://www.notion.so" class="fw700" target="_blank">You can find it here.</a>

Give it a spin. Tell me how it goes.
