Congratulations on being accepted to the program! We can promise that the next three years will be an exciting ride.

During your first week of class, you'll get a lot of important information on how each of your classes will work. It will be important to attend and take notes.

In Computer Graphics, we'll use our first class to get you set up with your laptop, software and college services.
