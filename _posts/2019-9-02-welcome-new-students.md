Congratulations on being accepted to the program! We can promise that the next three years will be an exciting ride.

Hopefully you'll attend AC Day 1 orientation. There are fun activities all over campus for the day. <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/orientation/ac-day-1/activities/" class="" target="_blank">See this page for a list of activities.</a>

During your first week of class, you'll get a lot of vital information on how each of your classes will work. It will be imperative to attend and take notes. Most importantly, ask questions!

In Computer Graphics, we'll use our first class to get you set up with your laptop, software and college services. I'll take any questions about technology purchases.
