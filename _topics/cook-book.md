  ## Thoughts on a Cook-book Project

  This assignment will include all the software skills students have learned to date. It should be self-directed.

  ### General Notes

  - Students will find their own content: recipes, <a href="https://cg.algonquindesign.ca/topics/stock.html" title="Stock Photography" target="_blank">stock photography</a>.
    - You will vet the content for quality.
    - Text needs to make sense. There needs to be enough text.
  - They'll create all original illustrations -- no stock illustrations allowed.
  - Book must have a theme.
    - ie: fisherman's guide to cooking fish. Kosher break-making, etc... The more specific the theme, the better.
  - The aesthetics of the book need to be distinctive & consistent.

  ### Logistics

  - You will be project lead and art director.
  - Students will devise a plan at the outset.
    - Theme (cooking subject matter)
    - Style tile
       - Photography

    - Type specimen

  - There will be weekly milestones. You'll do as Dave Bromley does in his courses. See each student each week to check-off that they've done that week's work.
