  ### Welcome!

  #### Our Present & Future

  - A bit of history.
  - Where could this program lead you?

  ### Let's Dive In!

  #### Classroom Management

  - The door will be locked once class starts. If you're late, wait for a break before coming in.
  - No phone use in class, unless on a break.
  - Want to provide anonymous feedback? Use the feedback form in the footer.

  #### Student Photos

  During our first class, we're going to take an individual photo of each of you for our faculty records.

  #### Academic Advising Questionnaire

  I'm going to give you a link to complete a questionnaire to support our academic advising efforts. We'll take time in class to fill out the form.
