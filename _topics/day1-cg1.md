  ### Welcome. Let's Dive In!

  - Where could this program lead you?

  #### First, Some Housekeeping

  - You must be on Zoom on time. I will not repeat instructions you may have missed if you come in late.
  - Add a clear headshot as your avatar on Zoom.
  - Turn on video. It's better for classroom morale all 'round.
  <!--   - The door will be locked once class starts. If you're late, wait for a break before coming in. -->
  - No phone use during class, unless on a break.
  - Want to provide anonymous feedback? Use this <a href="/administration/feedback.html" title="Submit anonymous feedback" target="_blank">anonymous feedback form</a>. The link is in the footer on every page of this site.
