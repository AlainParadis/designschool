  ### Welcome. Let's Dive In!

  - Where could this program lead you?

  #### First, Some Housekeeping

  - You must be on Zoom on time. I will not repeat instructions you may have missed if you come in late.
  <!--   - The door will be locked once class starts. If you're late, wait for a break before coming in. -->
  - No phone use during class, unless on a break.
  - Want to provide anonymous feedback? Use this <a href="/administration/feedback.html" title="Submit anonymous feedback" target="_blank">anonymous feedback form</a>. The link is in the footer on every page of this site.

  #### Your Program of Study

  We're review your Program of Study. These are the courses which you must successfully complete in order to graduate. Keep this PDF handy during your stay in the program. It's your responsibility to ensure you've progressed through all of these courses.

  <!--  #### Student Photos
  <span class="command"></span><span class="command"></span>
  I'd like you to take a head shot of yourself for your teachers to better learn your names. The photos will only be shared with your teachers and go nowhere else.

  This should be a clear photo of yourself, full frame, against a wall or another flat, untextured surface. A passport type photo will do the trick.

  Name your photo like this:

  <div class="textcenter fs12">last-name-first-name.jpg</div>

  <div class="button-wrapper"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/request/R0bV8U6vZ1wvPjP2Zz3P" title="Submit a photo of yourself." target="_blank" class="button">Submit Your Photo</a></div> -->

  #### Academic Advising Questionnaire

  We'd like to know a bit about you in an effort to be aware of any challenges you may be facing which could get in the way of your academic success. To that end, we'd appreciate if you filled out our Academic Advising Questionnaire.
