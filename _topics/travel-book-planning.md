description: "Publication design demands planning. You'll inventory content, sketch page layouts, search stock photography and more. The more planning you do, the smoother the production stage will be. Approval will be required before you can move to production."

  ### Publication Format

  The length and format of the publication is up to you. The one caveat is that you must use all of the provided text. You will source quality stock photography. You will also create vector illustrations to complement the aesthetics of the pages.

  Construction cannot go forward before all planning is complete. This is what you will produce.

  ### Inventory Content

  You must read all the provided text. Take an inventory of the structure of the text. Are there many levels of headings? Are bullet or number lists?

  ### Design Planning

  #### Style Guide

    You will create a multi-part style guide to show your design direction. Note that this will be much more specific than a mood board. It will actually display each element of your design. The goal is for us to clearly and completely see your design direction.

  #####  Photography

  Provide samples of photography to show consistency in style. You'll want to pay attention to:

  - framing
  - lighting
  - indoor/outdoor
  - object and/or people
  - colour
  - etc...

  #####  Illustration
  
    You will have at least one info-graphic taking up a minimum of a page or as much as a spread.

    You should have other illustrations as page decorations. It might be more convenient to place them on master pages rather than having to position them individually on each page.

  #####  Type Specimen

  The type specimen will communicate the typographic treatment in your work. It is _not_ a page layout. It's meant to show the font selection & hierarchy. That means it will include the various sizes, weights and colours.

  #### Publication Format

  The dimensions and binding type for your publication are important elements. For the dimensions, I suggest standard paper sizes. Build your 1/8" bleed and the amount of creep into your overall dimensions. *Best to build a mock-up*.
