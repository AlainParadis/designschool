description: "Publication design demands planning. You'll inventory content, sketch page layouts, search stock photography and more. The more planning you do, the smoother the production stage will be. Approval will be required before you can move to production."
details: |
  ### Publication Format

  The length and format of the publication is up to you. The one caveat is that you must use all of the provided text. You will source quality stock photography. You will also create vector illustrations to complement the aesthetics of the pages.

assignment: |
  Construction cannot go forward before all planning is complete. This is what you will produce.

  ### Inventory Content

  You must read all the provided text. Take an inventory of the structure of the text. Are there many levels of headings? Are bullet or number lists?

  ### Design Planning

  #### Style Guide

    You will create a multi-part style guide to show your design direction. Note that this will be much more specific than a mood board. It will actually display each element of your design. The goal is for us to clearly and completely see your design direction.

  #####  Photography

  Provide samples of photography to show consistency in style. You'll want to pay attention to:

  - framing
  - lighting
  - indoor/outdoor
  - object and/or people
  - colour
  - etc...

  #####  Illustration
  
    You will have at least one info-graphic taking up a minimum of a page or as much as a spread.

    You should have other illustrations as page decorations. It might be more convenient to place them on master pages rather than having to position them individually on each page.

  #####  Type Specimen

  The type specimen will communicate the typographic treatment in your work. It is _not_ a page layout. It's meant to show the font selection & hierarchy. That means it will include the various sizes, weights and colours.

  #### Publication Format

  The dimensions and binding type for your publication are important elements. For the dimensions, I suggest standard paper sizes. Build your 1/8" bleed and the amount of creep into your overall dimensions. *Best to build a mock-up*.

  ### Deliverables
  <p>You're going to get approval on a paper mock-up of your publication. Use the approximate number of pages you plan to have. Test the binding you intend to use on the final product.</p>
  <p>Print a tabloid sheet with photo treatments.</p>
  <p>Print a sheet with your type hierarchy. This should be set with your intended fonts</p>
  
  #### Paper Mock-up

  A paper mock-up is the best way to visualize your publication. You can test dimensions, binding and paper stock. This is a fun hands-on paper-craft activity. Use imagination to create a mock-up with design elements that may refer to the content. Maybe a simple die-cut or creative binding could allude to the subject matter.

  In industry, you would produce a mock-up that's clean enough to show your client. It should be well assembled and represent the final piece as closely as possible.

  #### Typography

  You should only use two type families in this project, unless you have a specific reason for using more. Choose families with a lot of variety; weight, italics, etc...
