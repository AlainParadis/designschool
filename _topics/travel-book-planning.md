description: "This is a semester-long, self-directed project with milestones. It will include publication design, photo manipulation and illustration. It is a software skills culminating performance for the Computer Graphics courses."
details: |
  This assignment will include all the software skills students have learned to date, brought together to create a travel book.

  ### Logistics

  Your instructor will be your project manager and your art director. They will critique your design decisions and work with you to design the best publication you can.

  You'll check in each class to ensure you're progressing with your work. Each check-in will contribute to your final grade.

  At each class, you will be provided guidance with the next step of development. There will also be a software tutorial to help you get that week's tasks completed.

  ### Project Stages

  #### Planning

  You will start by project planning the heck out of this. This will include making an inventory of the provided content.

  #### Development

  InDesign will be the hub in which we'll layout text, photography and illustrations.

  #### Output

   We'll output for multiple intents.

   1. Package
   2. PDF for press
   3. PDF for download
   4. ePub

  ### Publication Format

  The length and format of the publication is up to you. The one caveat is that you must use all of the provided text. You will source quality stock photography. You will also create vector illustrations to complement the aesthetics of the pages.

  Construction cannot go forward before all planning is complete. This is what you will produce.

  ### Inventory Content

  You must read all the provided text. Take an inventory of the structure of the text. Are there many levels of headings? Are bullet or number lists?

  ### Design Planning

  #### Style Guide

    You will create a multi-part style guide to show your design direction. Note that this will be much more specific than a mood board. It will actually display each element of your design. The goal is for us to clearly and completely see your design direction.

  #####  Photography

  Provide samples of photography to show consistency in style. You'll want to pay attention to:

  - framing
  - lighting
  - indoor/outdoor
  - object and/or people
  - colour
  - etc...

  #####  Illustration
  

  #####  Page graphics


  #####  Type specimen

    - Font selection
    - Type hierarchy
    - Paper mock-up
    - Binding - Whether it's printed it or not, they need to plan which type of binding it would use.
