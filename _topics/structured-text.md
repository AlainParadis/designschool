  <figcaption>
    This is a layout built with InDesign bullet lists and tabbed text.

  Make sure you use Bullets & Numbering to make the bullets built into a paragraph style and not typed in the text. Don't worry about getting every line break to match. We're looking for well executed styles.

  <figcaption>
    This layout is built from a series of separate tables in InDesign.
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

  Make sure you create table and paragraph styles for all content in the layout.

  <figure>
      <img class="size75" alt="indesign-next-and-nested-styles" src="/images/indesign-structured-text/indesign-next-and-nested-styles.jpg">
  <figcaption class="width75">
    This layout shows nested styles in the first column and next styles in the 2nd and 3rd columns.
  </figcaption>
  </figure>

  Apply the correct style to the first column, then create the nested style inside it. Set up next styles for columns 2 and three, then apply them automatically.
