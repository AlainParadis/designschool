  ## DSN1697 Concept Sketching 1

  - Minimum 30 sketches/drawings to be assessed;
  - Sketches/drawings should be loose and thumbnail like and can be from past project sketches/ideation but not actual assignments;
  - Sketches should show variety of mediums used (ie., pencil, pen, watercolour) and must be hand made (not computer generated);
  - Sketches can be any size and should show a variety of subject matter (people, objects, landscape, layouts, imaginative).
  - If you have a sketchbook for reviewing, even better!

  The overall objectives are thus:
  - Show the ability to sketch and work out ideas/ideate;
  - Show the use of different materials/tools to create drawings;
  - Focus is on making marks, drawing, experimenting and not thriving for perfection;
  - Show thinking process, layout, ideation.
