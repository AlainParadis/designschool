assignment: |
  Design a card for each of Ottawa's skateboard parks. Use the provided files to output a PDF file for each record in the spreadsheet.

  Create a card for each skateboard park in the city. The dimensions are half letter, so 8.5" wide x 5.5" tall Make sure you **use only Adobe Fonts** fonts in your design, so submitting will be simpler.

  Each card must have:

  * The photo of the park.
  * The Facility ID in an inconspicuous location.
  * The name of the park.
  * The address of the park.
  * An indication of the facility type.
  * An indication of whether it's access-controlled. You need to indicate a positive or negative status.
  * An indication whether it's accessible. You need to indicate a positive or negative status.

  </div>

  You need to have each of the types of variables in your file:

  * Text variables
  * Image variables
  * Visibility variables

  You'll need to edit this data file to make it do what you want: swap text, show/hide layers and swap photos. Once the spreadsheet is formatted as you want, export it as a .csv file. That's the file you'll import into Illustrator using the script.

  Once all of your variables are imported, double-check that everything works properly.

  Use the Batch command to export the data sets as Press-Ready PDF files into the provided 'PDFs' folder. Save your Illustrator file in place in the 'Your Exercise' folder. The .csv file should be in that folder too.
