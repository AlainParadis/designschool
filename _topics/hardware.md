description: "As students in a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program, you'll need to come to class with approved hardware. This is what you'll need and when."
details: |
  The Graphic Design Program is part of the College’s BYOD program, as such a Macintosh laptop is mandatory equipment. The base model 15” MacBook Pro is the minimum required equipment. The 13" laptops are too small for doing graphic design work. You need to come to each class equipped with a mouse and a mouse pad of your choice. If you purchase a new MacBook Pro, Apple’s AppleCare warranty is a good idea, though not mandatory.

  Computers should be purchased either at an Apple Retail store (<a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/rideau/" alt:="Apple Store Rideau" target="_blank">Rideau Centre</a> or <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/retail/bayshoreshoppingcentre/" alt:="Apple Store Bayshore" target="_blank">Bayshore</a>) or at <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro" alt:="Apple Store for Education" target="_blank">Apple’s online education store</a> to take advantage of their educational discount of 6 to 10 percent. You can also purchase a refurbished MacBook Pro from the <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/shop/browse/home/specialdeals" alt:="Refurbished Apple Store for Education" target="_blank">Apple online store</a>.

  It will be useful to bring earphones or headphones to class so you can listen to video tutorials, if needed. Keep them in your bag.
  
  Please allot $50 per year for an online backup service. <a href="http://www.backblaze.com" alt:="BackBlaze computer cloud backup." target="_blank">BackBlaze</a> is a good one.  Alternatively, you can purchase an external desktop hard drive at approximately $100. Any USB 3 unit at 2TB or above is sufficient. One of the two choices is mandatory.

  A basic Wacom drawing tablet (or equivalent) is also a suggested purchase, but not required. Approximate cost is $100.

  No printer or scanner is required.
