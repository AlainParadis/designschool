  <p><em>This is a 90 day PAID contract!</em></p>
  <p><em>You need to apply for a security clearance beforehand.</em> If you are interested, please get in touch with them ASAP.</p>
    <p>The process of briefing within the Government of Canada (GoC) has begun a gradual shift away from complicated and lengthy descriptions to short and telling visual snapshots (e.g. dashboards, client journey maps, etc.). This trend has affected the Admissibility Branch (a diverse policy branch within IRCC) in that many of the briefing materials either replacing or accompanying notes to senior management are being requested in visual format. As a result, the Admissibility Branch is looking to experiment with a dedicated resource to assist in the creation of visuals to support explanation of complex ideas to senior managers. The resource would be responsible for working with 4 divisions on files ranging from international information-sharing to seamless international travel flow.</p>
  <p>The resource is expected to have a background in visual design for print media, and would be expected to create graphics including dashboards, placemats, client journeys, tables, etc.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please be advised that the selected candidate will be required to undergo a security clearance as soon as possible.

  <p>Youth Ottawa is dedicated to demonstrating that youth are not (just) the future &ndash; instead, they are doing<br />
  incredible things for their communities right now, and they are capable of doing even more. Since 1997, we<br />
  have run programs and events which give youth the platform to prove that our communities are better when<br />
  they are engaged.</p>
  <p>Placement Description:</p>
  <p>This six week field work placement with Youth Ottawa will allow you to help develop our general graphic<br />
  design feel as well as working on specific visual communications pieces for our many programs and events.<br />
  Youth Ottawa has a general colour scheme and branding strategy, but we have not yet been able to apply this<br />
  to all of our overall communications and program and event materials.<br />
  We are also open to having more than one student working collaboratively on the development of these<br />
  materials, so this is a great opportunity to build your marketable skills as a graphic designer: not only by<br />
  practicing your graphic design skills but also in working as part of a team and also in developing an overall<br />
  strategy.<br />
  If you are interested in this opportunity, then please send your CV to us at info@youthottawa.ca. We hope to<br />
  hear from you!</p>

  Description: <br />
  I have a small woodworking business that would benefit greatly from having a graphic designer on board. This spring we are planning to launch a campaign targeted at bars around the city to tell them about our custom wood and stone barware. We are also launching a kickstarter at the beginning of April for an indie board game designed in the city. All these projects are in need of some help that an intern would be perfect for. There would be some woodworking involved too with the intern designing machine ready files and running both a CNC and laser cutter making new and custom products to add to my lineup. Please check out my website and if you have any questions please don't hesitate to email me.</p>
