  It's your job to formulate the questions to be as clear as possible. There isn't too much editing to do. There are a few questions that could stand some clarification. The bigger challenge is to decide which field type you will use in for each question.

  Limit your font and colour usage as much as possible. Build it on a letter-sized sheet.

  Save your document the usual way:
  
  <div class="attentionbox filename">
    Appleseed, Johnny, Group #, Form Design.indd
  </div>
  
  Once you're done, use the <span class="command">File > Package...</span> feature to gather assets related to the file. Because you've only used Adobe Fonts, there will be no fonts in the package folder.

  <mark>Add your fillable form PDF file to the folder.</mark> Replace the existing PDF, if there is one in the folder.

  Make sure the folder is named properly before you zip-compress it. Submit it on <a href="https://brightspace.algonquincollege.com/d2l/home" title="Submit on Brightspace" target="_blank">Brightspace</a>.

  ## Send for Signature

  In addition to submitting your assignment on Brightspace, you'll send it to me filled in and signed.

  Fill out your own form as if you were the respondent. Sign it once you're done. Use the Send and Track functionality to send it to my email address.
