  ### How This Works
  
  #### For Students

  The mentors below have offered their time to help you. First off, **please respect their time**. They're available for questions via e-mail and for portfolio development coaching. Some ground rules:
  
  - Do not spam many people at once.
  - Avoid sending large attachments. Use a cloud service, then send a link.
  - Be prepared before contacting a mentor. Gather multiple questions rather than peppering them many times.
  - These are potential employers! Be professional in all of your communications with them.

  Some mentors may have multiple requests. They're free to decline your request. If they do, move on to someone else.

  #### For Mentors

  First, thank you for your time! Your generosity is appreciated. If you receive more requests than you can respond to, please feel comfortable informing the student. Take as much or as little time as you wish with each request.

  If you know other experienced designers who would be mentors, please have them contact me at <a href="mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com">paradia@algonquincollege.com</a>. I'll add them to the list.

  **Corin Benoit** (he/him)<br />
  Chief Operating Officer and Creative Director, KB Media Corp.<br />
  Email: <a href="mailto:corinbenoit@gmail.com">corinbenoit@gmail.com</a><br />
  Design Specialty: I would describe myself as a brand manager/marketer for my clients. Although I do have a history of strengths in Illustration (traditional & digital), motion graphics, and logo design, my career path and interests have led me to direct creative teams to oversee branding development and deployment onto just about any medium, platform, and campaign. This can range from print, wide format graphics, web/mobile, video/motion, and digital advertising/marketing. I can also discuss creative direction/art direction with any students who aspire to take on that role in their careers. If a student wants to delve deep into conversation about the craft of UX/UI/product design, it would be best to seek the counsel of another mentor/industry expert. I've not needed to engage deeply enough in this realm of design to be able to do any justice to that specific field when compared to a seasoned specialist.<br />
  Note: Corin is very busy but can accommodate a couple of students via zoom. He requires a few days notice to schedule.<br />
