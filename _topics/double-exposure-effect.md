  Create a poster using your own double-exposure composition. Choose your favourite movie, game, tv show, book, etc  and create a poster that reflects the tone and story. Search online for hi-res images of actors, sceneries, objects, etc., or create your own.

  Don't forget there's a lot of <a href="/administration/stock.html" class="" target="_blank">high resolution stock photography here</a>. You can use photos of people from here in place of a real actor if you wish.

  You can use any and all of the techniques learned in class to get a pleasing result in a non-destructive manner.

  These are some examples of movie posters that use the double exposure effect.

  Specifications

  - 12” x 18” Poster (Portrait Orientation)
  - RGB @ 300dpi
  - Use Photoshop to create your double exposure
  - Use a mix of any programs to create your final poster and other assets (InDesign, Illustrator, etc...)

  #### How to Get an “A”

  You want to work in a non-destructive manner, so do stuff like:

  - Maintain all of your layers. Don’t flatten.
  - Name all of your layers.
  - Use Adjustment Layers.
  - Use Clipping Masks.
  - Convert regular layers to Smart Objects before re-sizing them.

  The aesthetics and composition of your poster should be pleasing and set the tone for the movie. Take the time and care to choose photos which will work well  and create a seamless effect.That is, the two photos blend seamlessly without obvious edges.
