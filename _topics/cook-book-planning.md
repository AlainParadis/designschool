  ## Thoughts on a Cook-book Project

  This assignment will include all the software skills students have learned to date. It should be self-directed.

  ### General Notes

  - Students will find their own content: recipes, <a href="https://cg.algonquindesign.ca/topics/stock.html" title="Stock Photography" target="_blank">stock photography</a>.
    - You will vet the content for quality.
    - Text needs to make sense. There needs to be enough text. *"I really like tons of white space."* is not allowed.
  - They'll create all original illustrations -- no stock illustrations allowed.
  - Book must have a theme.
    - ie: fisherman's guide to cooking fish. Kosher bread-making, etc... The more specific the theme, the better.
  - The aesthetics of the book need to be distinctive & consistent.
  - The book can veer off the cook-book path. It can tell a story, while the recipes are complimentary to that story.

  ### Logistics

  - You will be project lead and art director.
  - Students will devise a plan at the outset.
    - Theme (cooking subject matter)
    - Style tile
       - Photography
       - Illustration
       - Page graphics
    - Type specimen
      - Font selection
      - Type hierarchy
    - Paper mockup
    - Binding - Wether they print it or not, they need to plan which type of binding it would use.
  - There will be weekly milestones. You'll do as Dave Bromley does in his courses. See each student each week to check-off that they've done that week's work.
  - You critique their design decisions -- guide them.
  - This is a big project, but grading at the end of the semester should not be too bad, since you'll be checking in all semester.
  - Construction cannot go forward before all planning is complete
    - Paper mockup
    - Page grid design
