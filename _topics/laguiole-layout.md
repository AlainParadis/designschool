  Laguiole, pronounced *la-yol*, is a fine cutler from France. They've been making knives for hundreds of years. They're used by everyone from farmers to fine dining aficionados. You can see their products and read <a href="https://forge-de-laguiole.com/en/" title="Forge de Laguiole" target="_blank">about the company here</a>.

  ### Your Assignment

  You're going to build this layout in InDesign. You'll do the basic construction of the file on your own. Once you're done, we'll review how it was built. We'll fix what needs to be fixed.

  After the review, I'll walk you through prepping this for printing on an offset press.
