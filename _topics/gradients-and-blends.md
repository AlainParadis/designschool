  ### Gradients

  The Gradient Tool is a very powerful one. And with great power comes great responsibility. We'll learn to wield it like a true Jedi Master. The danger here is to create muddy colour transitions between our gradient stops. We'll build a drawing of a pencil using gradients in class. Once you're done, you'll possess secrets of the Gradient Tool.

  We'll explore:

  * The Gradient Panel
  * The Gradient Tool
  * The Gradient Annotator
  * Linear gradients
  * Radial gradients
  * Freeform gradients
  * Gradients on a path
  * Selecting colours for tasteful gradients
  * Opacity in gradients

  ### Blends

  The end-product of a blend can often look like a gradient, but they're much more versatile.

  > You can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between two objects. You can also blend between two open paths to create a smooth transition between objects, or you can combine blends of colors and objects to create color transitions in the shape of a particular object.

  We'll practice creating blends in class, starting with the basics, then move on to more advanced techniques. We'll draw a banner like this one, which contains a number of blends. Some are masked. Some are not. They're all stacked to create this wonderful graphic.

  ### Gradients

  Use gradients to add colour to the ping-pong paddle and ball.

  Note that the shading on the ball is created with a blend.

  ### Blends

  Draw a colouring pencil like the one shown below. You choose the colour of the pencil. These are the steps.
