description: "If you have a piece of artwork that repeats many times in your work, it's best to make a Symbol of it. The symbol can be edited, then all the instances you've used will update at once. You can even make colour variations with Dynamic Symbols."

assignment: |
  Create a single, letter-sized ad for a fictional company. It can be landscape or portrait orientation. Make sure to name your file like this from the outset:

  <div class="attentionbox filename">
    Appleseed, Johnny, Group #, Symbols.ai
  </div>

  Before you even start your work, delete all stock symbols from the Symbols panel. Go to the panel menu, then choose Select all unused. Delete them all. We want only your new, original symbols in the panel.

  <img class="size75" alt="symbols-assignment-example" src="/images/illustrator-symbols/symbols-assignment-examples.jpg">

  Make sure to include a Dynamic Symbol, with variations. Include symbols which are sprayed with the Symbol Sprayer tool.

  Use only Adobe Fonts.
