  ### Info Porn — Take Delight In Numbers.

  Choose a topic of interest. It could be baseball, motocycles, Barbie Dolls ... it's on you. Find some numbers related to it.

  You're going to buil a page layout **in InDesign** which contains these elements:

  * A title — Make it zingy.
  * Some explanatory text. Make it interesting, well written and error-free.
  * A graph — This is the visual centre piece of your design.
  * Other graphics to create a cohesive, topical design.

  To make sense of your graph, you'll give me an explainer. Put your information in context, graphically. Your graph needs to be delivered in the form of a cohesive, unified page design — a letter-sized page. <strong>Create this layout in InDesign.</strong>

   
  These are student examples:

  <figure>
      <img class="size100" alt="graph-layout-examples" src="/images/illustrator-graph-layout/graphs-layout-student-examples.jpg">

    These are examples of graph layouts created by past students.

  ### Production Details

  #### Build Your Graph

  Build your graph in Illustrator. As you build it, keep versions of the artwork in a single file so you can revert to a previous version, if needed. Name your Illustrator file:

  <div class="filename">graph-live.ai</div>

  When you place your graph in InDesign, you should place a native Illustrator (.ai) document.

  <div class="attentionbox achtung">
  It's important that the graph you place in InDesign is fully outlined. Before you place your graph, make sure you duplicate your document. Ungroup your graph. Click <span class="command">OK</span>. Also, select this duplicate graph, then expand it using <span class="command">Object > Expand...</span>. Click <span class="command">OK</span>.
  </div>

  Save your a duplicate of the Illustrator document as:

  <div class="filename">graph-outlined.ai</div>

  This is the one you're going to import into InDesign.

  Once the outlined graph is placed on the page in InDesign, you can do the rest of the layout there. Avoid placing a whole Illustrator layout in InDesign. <em>Only import the outlined graph.</em>

  Make sure to only use Adobe Fonts in your project. Keep track of font usage under <span class="command">Type > Find Fonts...</span>. The only fonts in the list should be the ones you're using in your design.
