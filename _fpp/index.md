course: "Fieldwork & PP"
description: "DSN1690 -- Joining and integrating into a working graphic design team is crucial to transitioning from the classroom to the design industry. Students are coached to market themselves as valuable candidates for positions in the field of design. They learn to present themselves and their portfolios professionally in an interview scenario. The course includes a student-lead graduation showcase event, where students display their work to industry professionals. The goal is to obtain a six-week fieldwork placement, where they will become contributing members of a design team and the industry as a whole."
