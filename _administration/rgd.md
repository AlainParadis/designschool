  This trip is open second & third year Graphic Design students on a voluntary basis. No partners or friends are allowed from outside the program. If you choose to attend, you may miss some classes. It will be up to you to ensure that you don't fall behind.

  <span class="">The trip will cost approximately $365.</span> Here's the breakdown:

  * $85 for the bus there and back.
    * <span class="limegreen">The cost of the bus could be less, if someone volunteers to go to the Student Association to get a subsidy.</span>
  * $95 for two nights in the hotel.
  * $186.75 to attend the conference & the studio tours.

  The only other item you'll be responsible for is your food and drink in Toronto.

  #### Hotel

  We'll likely be staying at the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/toronto/yyzls/hoteldetail" title="Holiday Inn Downtown" target="_blank">Holiday Inn Downtown</a> [<a href="http://bit.ly/2yENuf2" title="Holiday Inn Downtown Map" target="_blank">Google Map</a>]. There will be four people per room. One person per room needs to be assigned to pay for it. The three others can reimburse the person who's paid.

  ### Bus

  It's customary to give the driver a tip upon arrival back at the College. $2/passenger is standard. We'll need someone to collect the funds.

  ### Studio Crawl

  Once we arrive at the hotel, you'll be free to grab a bite then make your way to the RGD's offices to pick up your passport for the studio tours. Studio Crawl starts at 2:30pm on the 23rd.

  The main part of the conference is Wednesday and Thursday. We'll walk from the hotel to the conference centre.

  ### What happens to my classes?

  You shouldn't be penalized for attending a professional event like DesignThinkers. That said, you should take measures to complete work before attending. Do what you can to make the trip have the least impact on your studies. All faculty will do their best to make this fair for everyone, whether they attend the conference or not.

  More information about the trip will be posted here, so stay tuned.
