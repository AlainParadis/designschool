  This is a voluntary call out to all Graphic Design students who wish to purchase Pantone colour swatch books. I've gotten a price of $322.05 including shipping and taxes. For that price, you'll receive two books. One coated and one un-coated.

  Once I have enough people interested, I'll start collecting money to place an order.

  If anyone can find a better price for a group purchase, <a href="mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com">please contact me</a> to share the deal. The model numbers are:

  * GP6102N – Colour Bridge two-book set.
  * GG6103N - Single coated book.
  * GG6104N - Single uncoated book.
