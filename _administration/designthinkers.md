  #### Hotel

  We'll likely be staying at the <a href="https://www.ihg.com/holidayinnexpress/hotels/us/en/toronto/yyzls/hoteldetail" title="Holiday Inn Downtown" target="_blank">Holiday Inn Downtown</a> [<a href="http://bit.ly/2yENuf2" title="Holiday Inn Downtown Map" target="_blank">Google Map</a>]. There will be four people per room. One person per room needs to be assigned to pay for it. The three others can reimburse the person who's paid.

  ### Bus

  It's customary to give the driver a tip upon arrival back at the College. $2/passenger is standard. We'll need someone to collect the funds.

  ### Studio Crawl

  Once we arrive at the hotel, you'll be free to grab a bite then make your way to the RGD's offices to pick up your passport for the studio tours. Studio Crawl starts at 2:30pm on the 23rd.

  The main part of the conference is Wednesday and Thursday. We'll walk from the hotel to the conference centre.

  ### What happens to my classes?

  You shouldn't be penalized for attending a professional event like DesignThinkers. That said, you should take measures to complete work before attending. Do what you can to make the trip have the least impact on your studies. All faculty will do their best to make this fair for everyone, whether they attend the conference or not.

  More information about the trip will be posted here, so stay tuned.
