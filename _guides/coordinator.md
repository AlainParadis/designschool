  ### Request for Advanced Standing

  Weâ€™re thrilled to hear your daughter is interested in our program. The first step is to make an advanced standing application via OCAS. A $95 application fee will apply. The college also asks for a $50 advanced standing fee.

  Once the application is received we will ask her to submit her transcript and course syllabus for year 1 (level 1 and level 2) at Durham.  She may consider waiting to submit transcript after her level 1 (fall term) grades are entered and she is registered in level 2 (winter term). 

  She should also submit a portfolio. Requirements are posted here.

  We will review we review her documents and her portfolio, she will be informed of her entrance level in the program. We will need to confirm this after she has submitted her level 2 grades from Durham (likely in May or June).

  I hope this answers your questions. If you have anything further, please do not hesitate to contact me.

  Good luck. We hope to see her in our classrooms in September 2020.
