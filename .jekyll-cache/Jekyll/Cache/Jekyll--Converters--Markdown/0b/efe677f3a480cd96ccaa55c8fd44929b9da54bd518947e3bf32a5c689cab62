I"ç<p>The subject of your sketch must be an original character. Don‚Äôt use someone else‚Äôs artwork. Make sure your sketch has closed strokes, like the piggie example we used in class. The goal here is to use the Image Trace function in Illustrator.</p>

<p>The process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Scan or take a clear face-on photo with your phone. Place it on an artboard in Illustrator.</li>
  <li>Image Trace your sketch.</li>
  <li>Duplicate the traced image three times (for a total of 4 instances).</li>
  <li>Create three colour themes at <a href="https://color.adobe.com" target="_blank" title="Create colour themes...">color.adobe.com</a>. Apply them to one of your sketches.</li>
  <li>You‚Äôll finish with one un-coloured and three coloured instances of your sketch.</li>
</ul>
