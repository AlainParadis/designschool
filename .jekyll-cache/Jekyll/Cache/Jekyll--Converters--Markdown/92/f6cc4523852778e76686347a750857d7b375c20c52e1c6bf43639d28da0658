I":<p>Did your annoying uncle photobomb your best party pic? Let’s learn how to remove unwanted elements in a photo, so Uncle Hamish doesn’t put a damper on your next shindig.</p>

<p>Photoshop’s Content Aware tools are really good at filling in the background of a photo when you either delete or move an element. This is what Adobe has to say about Photoshop’s Content-Aware feature:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Content-Aware seamlessly fills the selection with similar image content nearby. For the best results, create a selection that extends slightly into the area you want to replicate. (A quick lasso or marquee selection is often sufficient.) <cite><a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/filling-stroking-selections-layers-paths.html#content_aware_pattern_or_history_fills" target="_blank" title="Adobe: Content-Aware Fill">Adobe</a></cite></p>

  Before performing any of these operations, it's important to duplicate the original layer, so we preserve our non-destructive workflow.

<p>Content-Aware fill is great for either deleting or moving elements in a photo.</p>

<h4 id="delete-an-element">Delete an Element</h4>

<p>In the image below, we want to erase the wires, the path and the fence. Select them with the Lasso Tool. Hit Shift-F5 to fill. Remember to duplicate the affected layer before cloning.</p>

  Select the elements of the photo, then use Content-Aware Fill to erase them on a duplicate of the layer.

<h4 id="move-an-element">Move an Element</h4>

<p>The microphone in the photo was obviously not positioned at the right location, above the woman. Let’s use the Content-Aware Move tool to shift it over. Remember to duplicate the layer before making the edit.</p>

  Select the microphone along with some of its surrounding content. Use the Content-Aware Move Tool to scootch it over.

<h3 id="content-aware-patch">Content-Aware Patch</h3>

<p>We can completely remove elements from a photo using the Patch Tool. It uses Content-Aware technology to fill intelligently.</p>

  Now she's there. Now she's gone. Use the Patch Tool with Content-Aware turned on to preserve the background.

</figure>
<p>All you need to do is use the Lasso Tool to select around the subject.Switch to the Patch Tool. Set it to Conent-Aware in the Control Bar. Move the subject to a carefully chosen area.</p>

<h3 id="content-aware-scale">Content-Aware Scale</h3>

<p>Content-Aware Scale allows you to stretch or shrink a photo. It fills in new areas between existing pixels with its best guess of how it should look. This works best with photos that have <em>low-energy</em> areas. Use   <span class="command">Edit &gt; Conent-Aware Scale</span> or hit <span class="command">⌘-Option-Shift-C</span> to envoke it.</p>

<h3 id="content-aware-crop">Content-Aware Crop</h3>

<p>While Content-Aware Scale adds pixels within the photo, Content-Aware Crop adds content on the outside of the photo. It expands the canvas, then fills in that new space intelligently.</p>

<figure>

<h3 id="photomerge">Photomerge</h3>

<p>Photoshop’s Photomerge feature stitches together a series of overlapping photos to create a panoramic composition. You can access it from <span class="command">File &gt; Automate &gt; Photomerge…</span></p>

<p>The Content-Aware feature is built right into the Photomerge process. Check the box at the bottom of the dialogue to turn it on.</p>

<p>If you turn off the composite layer, you’ll see the panorama without Content-Aware filled areas.</p>

<p>The Photomerge function behaves like a good Photoshop citizen, in a non-destructive manner. It saves separate layers with layer masks on each. If you need to, you can edit its work after the fact.</p>
