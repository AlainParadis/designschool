I"º<p>Letâ€™s draw our first isometric objects. Weâ€™ll start with a simple cube. Weâ€™ll explore how lighting can affect objects in surprising ways.</p>

<h3 id="isometric-transformations">Isometric Transformations</h3>

<p>Open the provided practice file. There are practice steps on each layer in the file. Weâ€™ll do these together.</p>

<h4 id="our-first-cube">Our First Cube</h4>

<p>Weâ€™ll use three identical squares and the angles indicated above to draw our first cube.</p>

<p><img alt="isometric transformations" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-transformations.svg" /></p>

<p>You can set an intial colour to the squares, then use the Colour Themes to create the lighting effects.</p>

<h4 id="a-box">A Box</h4>

<p>Letâ€™s test out some lighting effects. Draw a cube, then weâ€™ll make it look like itâ€™s hollow with the help of a light source.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="light-source" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-light-source.svg" /></p>

<p>Itâ€™s useful to place an orange circle off the page somewhere to remind me of my light source location. Once youâ€™ve done so, select colours which will create the lighting on the box.</p>

<h3 id="isometrics-actions">Isometrics: Actions</h3>

<p>Rather than drawing each facet of each object manually, weâ€™ll automate the process. Letâ€™s create actions to move facets the an isometric projection. Weâ€™ll also create actions to make them flat again. An <em>undo</em> of sorts.</p>

<h4 id="actions-setup-for-isometrics">Actions Setup for Isometrics</h4>

<p>There are three facets on an isometric object. If we were to position each facet manually, weâ€™d never finish a project. It would be much too tedious. Actions are the perfect solution to speed things up.</p>

  These are the basic operations which put shapes in isometric view.

<p>Create an Action for each of the transformations, then create an action with the exact reversed steps so we have an â€˜undoâ€™ function.</p>

<p>This is my Actions panel in Button Mode and normal mode. Access Button Mode from the panelâ€™s menu once youâ€™re done recording all the actions.</p>

<h3 id="isometrics-drawing-cylinders">Isometrics: Drawing Cylinders</h3>

<p>Drawing an isometric cube fits right into the grid. A cube is a natural. But what about a cylinder? Weâ€™ll explore how to draw cylindrical shapes in an isometric view.</p>

<h4 id="drawing-isometric-cylinders">Drawing Isometric Cylinders</h4>

<p>Weâ€™ll practice drawing a cylindrical shape.</p>

<figure>
  <img class="size100" alt="iso-my-first-cylinder" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-my-first-cylinder.svg" />
<figcaption>
  These are the steps used to create an isometric cylinder.

</figure>

<p>There are quite a few steps to draw a cylinder. Itâ€™ll be best if you repeat them oftenâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="geometric-shapes">Geometric Shapes</h3>

<p>There are more shapes than simple cubes. Weâ€™ll elaborate various different geometric shapes in isometric projection.</p>

<h4 id="other-geometric-shapes">Other Geometric Shapes</h4>

<p>Weâ€™ll create other geographic shapes with an isometric projection. Weâ€™ll create a pyramid, a cylinder, a cone, a pyramid and a hexagon and sphere. Childâ€™s play.</p>

<h3 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h3>

<p>Once weâ€™ve completed the task on each layer of the provided Illustrator document, youâ€™ll save it to submit on Brightspace.</p>
