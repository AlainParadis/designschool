I"4<p>Design a card for each of Ottawa’s skateboard parks. Use the provided files to output a PDF file for each record in the spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Create a card for each skateboard park in the city. The dimensions are half letter, so 8.5” wide x 5.5” tall Make sure you <strong>use only Adobe Fonts</strong> fonts in your design, so submitting will be simpler.</p>

<p>Each card must have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The photo of the park.</li>
  <li>The Facility ID in an inconspicuous location.</li>
  <li>The name of the park.</li>
  <li>The address of the park.</li>
  <li>An indication of the facility type.</li>
  <li>An indication of whether it’s access-controlled. You need to indicate a positive or negative status.</li>
  <li>An indication whether it’s accessible. You need to indicate a positive or negative status.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>You need to have each of the types of variables in your file:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text variables</li>
  <li>Image variables</li>
  <li>Visibility variables</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll need to edit this data file to make it do what you want: swap text, show/hide layers and swap photos. Once the spreadsheet is formatted as you want, export it as a .csv file. That’s the file you’ll import into Illustrator using the script.</p>

<p>Once all of your variables are imported, double-check that everything works properly.</p>

<p>Use the Batch command to export the data sets as Press-Ready PDF files into the provided ‘PDFs’ folder. Save your Illustrator file in place in the ‘Your Exercise’ folder. The .csv file should be in that folder too.</p>
