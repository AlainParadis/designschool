I"ª<p>This is a voluntary call out to all Graphic Design students who wish to purchase Pantone colour swatch books. Iâ€™ve gotten a price of $322.05 including shipping and taxes. For that price, youâ€™ll receive two books. One coated and one un-coated.</p>

<p>Once I have enough people interested, Iâ€™ll start collecting money to place an order.</p>

<p>If anyone can find a better price for a group purchase, <a href="mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com">please contact me</a> to share the deal. The model numbers are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GP6102N â€“ Colour Bridge two-book set.</li>
  <li>GG6103N - Single coated book.</li>
  <li>GG6104N - Single uncoated book.</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="size100" alt="pantone-colour-books" src="/images/general/pantone-colour-books.jpg" /></p>

<p>The books have four colour models: Spot colours, CMYK, RGB and HTML. Theyâ€™re the most versatile books you can buy.</p>
