<p>Replicate the objects using the shape tools in the provided document.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="Dawing with Shapes Summative" src="/images/illustrator-fundamentals/drawing-with-shapes-summative.svg" /></p>

<p>There may be more than one way to get to the same result. As long as youâ€™re using shape tools, itâ€™s fine. Once youâ€™re done, save and close the document.</p>

<h3 id="pen-tool">Pen Tool</h3>

<p>Trace the provided image with the Pen Tool only. Use strokes only. Once youâ€™re done, duplicate the illustration with strokes, then colour fill it, as shown below. The goal is to create the most accurate paths possible with the fewest anchor points.</p>

<p><img class="size100 center" alt="pen-tool" src="/images/illustrator-fundamentals/pen-tool.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is much like a real-life scenario, where you would draw something by hand, then trace it in Illustrator to create scalable vector artwork.</p>

<p>Draw the sprinkles with the Pen Tool too.</p>

<div class="attentionbox achtung">
  All of your shapes need to be closed in order for them to fill with colour properly.
</div>

<p>Once youâ€™re done, simply save and close the document.</p>

<h3 id="type-in-illustrator">Type in Illustrator</h3>

<p>Create a new Illustrator document with the specifications shown below. Use point type and area type where appropriate.</p>

<p>Save the file into the exercise folder named: <span class="fw500 darkgreen">03-illustrator-type-summative.ai</span></p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="Illustrator Type Summative" src="/images/illustrator-fundamentals/illustrator-type-summative.svg" /></p>

<p>All the text is set in <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova" class="fw700" target="_blank">Proxima Nova font</a>. Make a paragraph style for each:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Title: 44pt, Extra Bold</li>
  <li>Intro: 10pt, Bold</li>
  <li>Text: 10pt, Regular</li>
</ul>

<p>Set the slogan and URL manually (no paragraph style):</p>

<ul>
  <li>URL: 24pt, Extra Bold &amp; Regular</li>
</ul>

<p>See the model above as a guide for where to use point type vs. area type. Make sure you use the <span class="command">Indents &amp; Spacing &gt; Space After</span> setting at 4pt in your paragraph style to create spacing between paragraphs, as shown. Once complete, âŒ˜-S, then âŒ˜-W.</p>

<h3 id="colour-swatches">Colour Swatches</h3>

<p>Assign colours to the provided logo adhering to the guide images.</p>
