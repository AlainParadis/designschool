<p>Your program of study is the list of courses you need to take in order to graduate. It just happens that we change our program of study yearly to accommodate the needs of the design industry.</p>

<p>The program of study you must complete is the one for the year you started in the program. There are exceptions, but this is how it works for most.</p>

<h3 id="yikes-ive-failed-a-course">Yikes! I’ve Failed a Course.</h3>

<p>If you happen to fail a course, you’ll be <em>off-cycle</em>. That means that you will not flow through the program of study in the same order. It may mean that you’ll study for an additional semester or year. In most cases, courses given in the Fall are only given in the Fall. The same goes with Winter courses. If you’ve failed a course given in Winter, you may need to wait until the next Winter to take it again.</p>

<p>If that course is a pre-requisite for another, you will not be allowed to progress in that course.</p>

<div class="attentionbox reminder">
    It would be a good idea for you to print your program of study to mark the courses you have successfully completed.
