I"¼,<p>This assignment will be a skills refresher on top of learning the InDesign Book skills. Weâ€™ll build a document with:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Automatic page numbers</li>
  <li>Custom colour swatches</li>
  <li>Paragraph styles</li>
  <li>Character Styles</li>
  <li>Defined number lists</li>
  <li>Chapter titles</li>
  <li>Running headers</li>
  <li>Table of contents</li>
</ol>

<p>Youâ€™ve done all this before. The beauty of using these features with a book file is that they all sync across documents.</p>

<h3 id="why-book-files">Why Book Files?</h3>

<p><img class="size15 left" alt="indesign-book-file-icon" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-book-file-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>Working with books in InDesign is useful when youâ€™re creating a very long document. You can break your publication into separate documents, which improves performance. Once you have a book file, you can synchronize features like colour swatches, text styles and more. Books files also make exporting and packaging long documents easier.</p>

<p>Collaboration is smoother with book files, since the book file is a container for the included InDesign documents. Many different designers can work on separate InDesign documents which make up a single book. All the filesâ€™ attributes will stay in sync.</p>

<p>Reserve the use of book files to very long documents; letâ€™s say over 100 or 150 pages. You can also create a book file for a shorter book thatâ€™s built with many, short InDesign documents. Itâ€™s not necessary to have all that extra book functionality for a document you can easily manage in one file.</p>

</figure>
<p>To create a book file, go <span class="command">File &gt; New &gt; Bookâ€¦</span>. What appears is the Book panel. Itâ€™s a container for InDesign documents.</p>

<h4 id="not-a-panel-not-a-document">Not a Panel, Not a Document</h4>

<p>Despite the appearance of the Book panel. It doesnâ€™t actually behave like a panel. For instance, you cannot find it in the Window menu to open the panel. It actually behaves more like a document. It has a Save command. To open it, you either double-click on its icon in Finder or you use the <span class="command">File &gt; Openâ€¦</span> command.</p>

<p>You can also have more than one book file open at a time.</p>

<h3 id="add-documents-to-a-book-file">Add documents to a book file</h3>

<p>To add files to the book, click on the âž• button at the bottom of the Book panel. Navigate on your Mac to your InDesign documents, then open them.</p>

<p>They may not get added in the order you want. Simply click and drag it into the right order.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  When you add InDesign documents to a book file, you're not duplicating them. You're simply establishing a relationship between the book file and the InDesign documents.
</div>

<figure>

  <li>Save book</li>
  <li>Print/Export book</li>
  <li>Add/Remove documents</li>
  <li>A second open book file</li>
</ol>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the left side of the panel, thereâ€™s a column where you can establish the style source for the book. The style source is the master document for the book. Itâ€™s used to set the source for styles, swatches, master pages, lists, text variables and more.</p>

<p>To the right, we see the page range. To the right of that thereâ€™s a column for the documentâ€™s open status. To the right of that, thereâ€™s a column for the documentâ€™s preflight status.</p>

<p>The Book panelâ€™s menu is full of useful commands for managing books.</p>

<h3 id="manage-book-files">Manage book files</h3>

<p>With InDesign books, you can establish numbering in a master document, then have them sync across all the files in the book. You can add or remove documents in the Book panel. You can also re-order them by dragging them up and down the panel.</p>

<p>Remember that the Book panel only refers to the InDesign documents it contains. If you move or delete the originals from your computer, the panel will lose control of them.</p>

<h3 id="numbering-pages">Numbering Pages</h3>

<p>The numbering options are found in the Book panel menu. You can edit settings for a single document in the book or for the whole book. All the regular numbering options are there. You can set roman numerals or arabic numerals and so on.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size75" alt="indesign-books-document-numbering" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-document-numbering.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  You can double-click on the page numbers in the Book panel to access Document Numbering options.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When editing the book page numbering options, you can set the page order. You can even set the start of a chapter to always be on a right-hand page. InDesign can automatically insert a blank page to make that happen.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size75" alt="indesign-books-chapter-numbering" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-chapter-numbering.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Chapter numbering is accessed in the Document Numbering Options.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Chapter numbering is accessed in the Document Numbering Options. Numbering can be forced or can be set automatically. Each document can only have one chapter number. Weâ€™d set up our book so that each document contains a single chapter. You could also make it so one chapter is composed of multiple documents. Weâ€™d use Same as Previous Document.</p>

<figure>
  <img class="size100" alt="indesign-books-update-numbering" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-update-numbering.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Remember that if you change the number or the order of documents in the book file, you need to update numbering from the Book panel menu.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Imagine that you have a numbered list that continues throughout multiple documents in a book. You can control whether numbers conitnue from one document to another within a book. For some reason, InDesign calls number lists <em>paragraph numbers</em>.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="indesign-books-number-lists" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-number-lists.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  You can make numbered lists continue across documents in a book.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>To do so, you need to define a numbered list. You create a defined number list in the paragraph styles panel, in Bullets &amp; Numbering. <a href="bullet-and-number-lists.html" title="InDesign Bullet &amp; Number Lists">Read lots about lists here.</a></p>

<h3 id="colour-swatches">Colour Swatches</h3>

<p>Book files can sync colour swatch properties across their documents. If youâ€™re using CMYK colours, itâ€™s best to give them a name. It could something like <em>Algonquin Green</em>. Pantone will sync normally. Never edit a Pantone colourâ€™s name.</p>

<h3 id="tables-of-contents">Tables of Contents</h3>

<p>When you build a TOC using InDesignâ€™s <span class="command">Layout &gt; Table of Contentsâ€¦</span> feature, it can take all the individual book documents into account.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="indesign-books-toc" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-toc.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  All text styles are set in the above dialogue. Check "Include Book Documents".
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If you make changes to content in the book files, simply update the TOC from the <span class="command">Layout</span> menu.</p>

<h3 id="synchronize-book-documents">Synchronize book documents</h3>

<p>One of the great benefits of working with book files in InDesign is the ability to synchronize paragraph styles and more across documents in a book.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size33" alt="indesign-books-synchronize-panel" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-synchronize-panel.jpg" />
<figcaption>
<ol>
  <li>Indicates style source</li>
  <li>Synchronize styles &amp; swatches</li>
</ol>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="attentionbox achtung">
  Syncing cannot be undone unless you have the documents open before you sync! If they're open, it'll be up to you to save &amp; close. If they're closed, they'll open, sync, then close.
  </div>

<p>Sync is a really difficult thing to program. Youâ€™ll undoubtedly find issues you need to fix. Thatâ€™s why Adobe made it non-destructive. It tends to add across documents more than deleting. Note that if you rename styles or swatches, youâ€™ll break InDesignâ€™s ability to sync that item. You may need to do some manual clean-up.</p>

<h3 id="what-will-sync">What Will Sync?</h3>

<p>You can choose what to synchronize across all your bookâ€™s documents. Everything important can sync.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size75" alt="indesign-books-sync-options" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-sync-options.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Option-click on the Synchronize button to see and edit what you can sync. Check on "Master Pages".
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Youâ€™ll notice that layers donâ€™t sync. The trick to get around this is simply to put an item from each layer on a Master Page, then sync Master Pages. That will make them sync.</p>

<h2 id="print-or-output-a-book-file">Print or output a book file</h2>

<h3 id="preflighting">Preflighting</h3>

<p>You can really make the most of InDesignâ€™s Preflight feature by running it on all the documents in a book.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="indesign-books-preflighting" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-preflighting.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Make the most of InDesign's Preflight function by applying it to all documents in a book.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There are a number of options you can choose to preflight. Either way, once itâ€™s done its thing, youâ€™ll get a green light if your documents are okay or a red light if theyâ€™re not.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size33" alt="indesign-books-preflight-errors" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-books-preflight-errors.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  This document is royally messed up.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We need to open each of this bookâ€™s documents to resolve each issue. Once weâ€™re done, weâ€™ll need to run the preflight feature again until we get green lights across the board.</p>

<h3 id="output-your-book">Output Your Book</h3>

<p>âŒ˜-P wonâ€™t work to print a book. You need to use the Book panelâ€™s menu to output the book.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size50" alt="indesign-book-output-menu" src="/images/indesign-books/indesign-book-output-menu.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  You can print a whole book, or you can export to various formats.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
 If you hold the Option key while you click the Book panel's Print button, you'll get the Export dialogue!
</div>

<p>As you can see, working with a book file can save a lot of time compared to working with one long document. Theyâ€™ll help you keep things in sync between documents. You can also preflight and output really easily.</p>
