<p><a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts" target="_blank" title="Adobe Fonts">Adobe Fonts</a> is an online font subscription service. As a participant in a <em>Bring Your Own Device</em> (BYOD) program at Algonquin College, you have access to the service.</p>

<p>Fonts on Adobe Fonts can be used on web sites or in documents for print.</p>

<h3 id="local-fonts">Local Fonts</h3>

<p>Sometimes you may need to install a specific font on your computer. The video above shows you how to set up a simple font management system that doesnâ€™t require installing any software.</p>

<p>The Fonts folder you want to use to install fonts is in your Home Directoryâ€™s Library folder. To get to it, go to the Finderâ€™s Go menu. Hold the Option key, then choose Library.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a good idea to <em>copy</em> font folders into this location rather than move them. If you copy them, the originals will stay in place, with your project. Every once in a while, you can move all fonts in the Fonts folder to the trash without having to worry about losing the originals.</p>

<h3 id="checking-font-usage">Checking Font Usage</h3>

<p>In the past, when you moved a document from one computer to another, you needed to move the fonts along with it. If you didnâ€™t the document wouldnâ€™t look the same when opened. With the advent of online font services like Adobe Fonts, this is less of a concern. If youâ€™re using Adobe Fonts, when you open the document, youâ€™re prompted to activate the fonts requested by that document.</p>

<p>If the designer used fonts they installed locally, on their computer, those fonts need to move with the document. Thatâ€™s what InDesignâ€™s &amp; Illustratorâ€™s <span class="command">File &gt; Packageâ€¦</span> function is for.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="find-font-dialogue" src="/images/using-fonts/find-font-dialogue.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can check which fonts are in use in a specific document by using <span class="command">Type &gt; Find Fontâ€¦</span> in InDesign and in Illustrator. You can see that you can substitute fonts from this dialogue with the <span class="command">Change</span> button.</p>

<h3 id="packaging">Packaging</h3>

<p>Packaging a document gathers and copies all associated files into a new folder. These files include the original document, placed images and fonts. The packaging process does not gather Adobe Fonts.</p>

<p>Illustrator and InDesign have a Package function. Photoshop has one, but itâ€™s not used for the same reasons. Photoshopâ€™s Package function does not gather fonts. It only gathers linked images.</p>
