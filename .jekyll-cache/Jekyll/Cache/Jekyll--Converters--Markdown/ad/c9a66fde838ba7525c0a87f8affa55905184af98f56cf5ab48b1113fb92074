<p>Isometric illustration is a type of 3D illustration. Rather than having lines lead to vanishing points, those lines are parallel. Isometric illustration is a very functional type of illustration which can communicate a message in a simple way that other styles cannot. It‚Äôs both fun and very effective. And the process is at once challenging and rewarding. <a href="https://goo.gl/ueH6qT" title="Examples of isometric illustrations" target="_blank">These are some examples</a> of isometric illustration.</p>

<p><img alt="Isometrics vs Perspective" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/persp-vs-iso.svg" /></p>

<p>See how isometric illustration differs from 2-point perspective drawing. This is how isometric transformations work. We‚Äôll examine how to build such shapes in Illustrator quickly and accurately.</p>

<p>One benefit which makes working in an isometric projection is that you can move objects anywhere in the scene. The objects fit to the isometric grid no matter where they are on the page. You can scale them at will. Because there are no vanishing points, everything just fits. You can give the illusion of perspective simply by positioning objects and scaling them.</p>

<h3 id="impressive-isometrics-portfolios">Impressive Isometrics Portfolios</h3>

<p>These are are a few portfolios of artists who excess at drawing in the isometric form. The first and most important one to look at is <a href="http://www.glitschkastudios.com" title="Von Glitschka" target="_blank">Von Glitschka‚Äôs web site</a>. He was the inspiration for this assignment.</p>

<h3 id="isometrics-illustrator-setup">Isometrics: Illustrator Setup</h3>

<p>Before we can draw isometric shapes, we need to change a number of settings in Illustrator.</p>

<h3 id="setup-illustrator">Setup Illustrator</h3>

<h4 id="edit-default-ai-document">Edit default .ai document</h4>

<p>We‚Äôll take a moment to edit our default Illustrator document. This task isn‚Äôt specific to this project. It‚Äôs just a useful thing to do.</p>

<p><img alt="illustrator-default-document-path" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/illustrator-default-document-path.jpg" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Change your default fill/stroke to black stroke, no fill.</li>
  <li>Add a ‚Öõ‚Äù bleed. That‚Äôs 0.125‚Äù or 9 points.</li>
  <li>Change the default stroke to 0.5 points.</li>
  <li>Delete all content from the Graphic Styles panel.</li>
  <li>Delete all Symbols from their panel.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="create-an-isometric-workspace">Create an Isometric Workspace</h4>

<p>We‚Äôll create a new custom workspace with these panels. Open only these panels.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Layers</li>
  <li>Appearance</li>
  <li>Graphic Styles</li>
  <li>Actions</li>
  <li>Swatches</li>
  <li>Colour</li>
  <li>Colour Guide</li>
  <li>Gradient</li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have them all placed where you want them, go <span class="command">Window &gt; Workspace &gt; New Workspace‚Ä¶</span>. Give it a name, like Isometrics.</p>

<h4 id="smart-guides-setup">Smart Guides Setup</h4>

<p>We‚Äôll go to the Illustrator menu, then <span class="command">Preferences &gt; Smart Guides‚Ä¶</span></p>

<figure>
    <img class="size75" alt="iso-preferences-smart-guides" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-preferences-smart-guides.jpg" />

  We'll set Illustrator's Smart Guides prefs to help us draw isometrically.

</figure>

<p>This allows you to draw free-hand with the Pen Tool while using the Smart Guides to help you stay in an isometric projection. So, you don‚Äôt need to use your actions for everything.</p>

<div class="attentionbox shortcut">
  Toggle Smart Guides on and off with ‚åò-U.
</div>

<h3 id="important-keyboard-shortcuts">Important Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Selection tool: v</li>
  <li>Direct Selection tool: a</li>
  <li>Temp switch to Move tool: hold ‚åò</li>
  <li>Lock selection: ‚åò-2</li>
  <li>Unlock all: ‚åò ‚å• 2</li>
  <li>Bring to front or send to back: ‚åò ‚áß [ or ]</li>
  <li>Smart Guides on/off: ‚åò-U</li>
  <li>View as outlines on/off: ‚åò-Y</li>
  <li>Paste in front: ‚åò-F</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="isometrics-start-with-a-grid">Isometrics: Start with a Grid</h3>

<p>We‚Äôll need a grid to guide us in sketching our isometric illustration. In this unit, we‚Äôll draw that grid on our page which we can also use to draw our final work.</p>

<h4 id="draw-an-isometric-grid">Draw an Isometric Grid</h4>

<p>We‚Äôll draw a grid which we‚Äôll be able to print to sketch with. We‚Äôll also be able to use it to draw our work with.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="isometric grid" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-grid.svg" /></p>

<p>We‚Äôll create vertical strokes across the page at equal increments. This increment will be the density of your grid. Once you have paths across the page, rotate them all -60¬∫. Once you‚Äôve done so, reflect the rotated ones vertically. You‚Äôll end up with the effect above.</p>

<p>If you stare at the grid long enough, you‚Äôll get the illusion of seeing cubes throughout.</p>

<p>Draw a rectangle over the whole page. Select all your artwork and type <span class="command">‚åò-7</span> to create a Clipping Group. Now you have a grid you can print. Print one, then use a tracing paper overlay to draw your sketches.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="create-an-isometric-grid" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/create-an-isometric-grid.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="create-illustrator-guides">Create Illustrator Guides</h3>

<p>You can use the grid you‚Äôve drawn to create guides on your page in Illustrator. Duplicated the whole grid.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Type Option-‚åò-7 to release the Clipping Mask. Once you‚Äôve done so, select all the paths.</li>
  <li>Type ‚åò-5 to convert paths to guides. You‚Äôll want to make sure they‚Äôre locked.</li>
  <li>Type Option-‚åò-; to lock/unlock guides.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="isometrics-tonal-values">Isometrics: Tonal Values</h3>

<p>Lighting is a crucial ingredient in an isometric illustration. It‚Äôs really going to drive home the three dimensional appearance of your artwork. We‚Äôll set up swatches with tonal values to help you get there.</p>

<h4 id="create-tonal-value-swatches">Create Tonal Value Swatches</h4>

<p>Lighting is really what brings life to isometric illustrations. To create lighting effects, we‚Äôll choose a key colour. We will then derive a range of tonal values from that colour using the Colour Guide panel. The colours will be saved in our Swatches panel for easy access.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="iso-colour-themes" src="/images/illustrator-isometric-illustration/iso-colour-values.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can add colours to your Swatches Panel and you can also leave colour chips outside of your artboard.</p>

<p>Remember, while you have an active Eye Dropper tool, you can hold the ‚åò key to temporarily switch to the Selection Tool to select artwork, then sample a new colour.</p>
