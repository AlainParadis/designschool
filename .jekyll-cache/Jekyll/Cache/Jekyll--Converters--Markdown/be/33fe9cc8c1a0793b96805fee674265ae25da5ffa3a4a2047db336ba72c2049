<p>Save an close the image.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="selecting-exercise-lasso" src="/images/photoshop-selecting/selecting-exercise-lasso.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can use the Hand Tool with the Space Bar to pan around the image. âŒ˜-plus and âŒ˜-minus works while youâ€™re selecting. Once youâ€™ve made a selection for one of the screens, add a Layer Mask to the appropriate poster graphic as shown above.</p>

<h3 id="colour-range">Colour Range</h3>

<p>Use <span class="command">Select &gt; Colour Rangeâ€¦</span> to select the orange part of the van. We want to make the orange turn to yellow.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="secting-exercise-colour-range" src="/images/photoshop-selecting/secting-exercise-colour-range.jpg" /></p>

<p>Youâ€™re not going to get it all with the Colour Range function. Add your Hue/Saturation Adjustment Layer to change the orange to yellow. Paint white or black on the mask to edit it. Whatâ€™s white on the mask will become yellow.</p>

<h3 id="select-focus-area">Select Focus Area</h3>

<p>Weâ€™re going to mask the guy from the background using <span class="command">Select &gt; Focus Areaâ€¦</span>. Once the preview looks good enough in the Focus Area dialogue, make sure Output is set to <span class="command">New Layer with Layer Mask</span>.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="selecting-exercise-focus-area" src="/images/photoshop-selecting/selecting-exercise-focus-area.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can use <span class="command">Select and Maskâ€¦</span> to refine the Mask.</p>

<h3 id="quick-mask">Quick Mask</h3>

<p>Start by using the Quick Selection Tool to select most of the bag. Once you have most of it done, switch to Quick Mask mode to select the rest.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="selecting-exercise-quick-mask" src="/images/photoshop-selecting/selecting-exercise-quick-mask.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use a softer brush to paint where the image is blurry. Once you have a good selection, add a Hue/Saturation Adjustment Layer and increase the saturation. Itâ€™ll make the leather look a bit more orange; more vibrant.</p>

<h3 id="vector-mask">Vector Mask</h3>

<p>Use the Pen Tool in <span class="command">Path</span> mode. Draw around the perimeter of the screen, making slightly rounded corners. Be accurate.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="selecting-exercise-vector-mask" src="/images/photoshop-selecting/selecting-exercise-vector-mask.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once your path is complete, turn on the top layer. Use <span class="command">Layer &gt; Vector Mask &gt; Current Path</span>. This will hide the excess content on the poster to make it fit the device screen. Hide the background layerâ€™s visibility so we can see the masking.</p>

<h3 id="clipping-path">Clipping Path</h3>

<p>Create a path around the cheese. Donâ€™t forget to draw the voide in the center.</p>
