<p>Letâ€™s build the file below to get the hang of creating and managing different types of layers.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-layers-exercise" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-layers-exercise.jpg" /></p>

<p>Start by creating a letter-sized landscape document.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="photoshop-layers-document-setup" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-layers-document-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>Weâ€™ll drag the photos into our canvas so they become Smart Objects. This allows for non-destructive resizing.</p>

<p>We need to create guides to line up all of our content in a structured layout. Go <span class="command">View &gt; New Guide Layoutâ€¦</span></p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="photoshop-new-guide-layout" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-new-guide-layout.jpg" /></p>

<p>Weâ€™ll use the Free Transform command to resize photos to fit our grid. Make sure you import the provided title text. Itâ€™s an Illustrator document.</p>

<p>Use the vector rectangle tool to create a rectangle behind the four photos. We can use the fill controls in the Control Bar to choose a colour.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photohsop-exercise-shape-layer" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photohsop-exercise-shape-layer.jpg" /></p>

<p>Next, weâ€™ll apply a stroke effect to the four smaller photos. To do this, go to the Fx menu at the bottom of the Layers panel and choose Stroke.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photohsop-exercise-stroke-effect" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photohsop-exercise-stroke-effect.jpg" /></p>

<p>Add an 8pt white stroke to the photos. Weâ€™ll apply the effect to the layer group so it applies to all the layers inside it.</p>

<p>To fill your frame with text, you can go to the Type menu: Type &gt; Paste Lorem Ipsum. You can change the colour of your type from the colour control in the Control Bar. Target your type tool and the type layer to do so.</p>

<p>Lastly, we can make our title graphic stand out a bit more with Layer Effects. We can use a Colour Overlay and an Outer Glow or a Drop Shadow.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-exercise-layer-effects" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-exercise-layer-effects.jpg" /></p>

<p>There we go. Weâ€™ve successfully used the Layers Panel to create a layout in Photoshop in a non-destructive workflow.</p>
