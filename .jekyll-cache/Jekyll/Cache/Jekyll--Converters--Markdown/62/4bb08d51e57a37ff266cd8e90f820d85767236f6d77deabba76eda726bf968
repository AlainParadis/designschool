<p>In this project, our goal is a very natural media aesthetic. The strokes weâ€™ll apply in Illustrator will be our own creations. This makes our artwork all the more unique.</p>

<p>Creating very authentic looking painted artwork in Illustrator is a lot of fun. Weâ€™ll explore the process from paint brush to vectors, aiming to get a very natural look. The very first step is to draw on paper with paint and actual brushes.</p>

<h3 id="brush-strokes-on-paper">Brush Strokes on Paper</h3>

<p>Weâ€™ll start by painting strokes on paper. Weâ€™ll need to paint a variety of types of strokes. Make variations on three different types. Create strokes of varying darkness, length and width. These will made into Art Brushes. Make narrower strokes for line work, which will be made into Pattern Brushes. Lastly, use a old toothbrush to spatter paint on the page. These will be made into Scatter Brushes.</p>
