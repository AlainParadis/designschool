I"”<p>The NDP party want banners created for each member. There are about 100 in total. Youâ€™ll design and produce a banner which will be replicated for each member.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll be given a larger number of data sets for which you will design web a banner. They are for the New Democratic Party. They need to include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A title/slogan</li>
  <li>The party logo</li>
  <li>A mug shot of the party member</li>
  <li>The memberâ€™s name</li>
  <li>The memberâ€™s constituency name</li>
  <li>The memberâ€™s province</li>
  <li>A short paragraph of issue-based text.</li>
  <li>Graphics related to the topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>Youâ€™re to mimic my practice file with a different layout and content. The <a href="http://www.ndp.ca" title="The NDP Web Site" target="_blank">NDP web site</a> is a great source for issue-based copy. Start with setting up a Photoshop file measuring <strong>300 pixels X 600 pixels</strong>, either tall or wide. Youâ€™ll gather messaging from the NDP web site. Youâ€™ll need to adapt the provided spreadsheet to suit your designâ€™s Photoshop layers.</p>

<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

<p>Submitting all those native, layered Photoshop files is going to be too big. What we need to do is produce them, but then use an Action or the Image Processor to create jpeg files to submit. So do not submit the .psd files you generated. Only submit your original design file.</p>

<p>Use only Adobe Fonts, so you donâ€™t need to worry about submitting them.</p>

<p>This is what youâ€™ll submit.</p>

<p><img alt="Data Driven Graphics Deliverables" src="/images/photoshop-data-driven-graphics/deliverables.gif" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Your design in a layered .psd file.</li>
  <li>All the generated jpeg files.</li>
  <li>Your edited .csv files.</li>
</ol>

<p>Youâ€™ll be graded on successfully creating the data driven graphics. Make it a professional design thatâ€™s consistent with the NDP brand.</p>
