I"ó<p>Mark Twain said ‚ÄúThere are lies, damned lies, and statistics.‚Äù That may be true. Well, consider yourself an interpreter of those lies. Columns representing numbers are pretty lame. As designers, it is our job to represent information in an interesting and informative manner. Luckily, Adobe has provided some really great graphing tools in Illustrator. This is what we are going to explore this week.</p>

<h3 id="about-illustrator-graphs">About Illustrator Graphs</h3>

<p>An Illustrator graph is special type of live, grouped object. When you select a graph, Illustrator‚Äôs Object Type Indicator tells us it‚Äôs a live graph object.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="graph-object-type" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-object-type.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you ungroup a graph, Illustrator will put up a warning that it won‚Äôt be live anymore. This means the data won‚Äôt be editable. If you absolutely must ungroup a graph, make a copy of it first, so you can go back to the live graph if necessary.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-draw-a-graph">How to Draw a Graph</h3>

<p>To draw a graph, it‚Äôs important to have data well formatted ahead of time. Simply take one of the graph tools and draw a rectangle where you want the graph. The data window will open automatically. Type in your data. Once you‚Äôre done, hit the check mark button or hit Enter (not Return)</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="graph-example" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-example.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once you hit Enter, you‚Äôll get a live preview of the graph. If you find you‚Äôve entered the data on the wrong axis, just hit the Transpose button in the graph window.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="graph-number-labels" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-number-labels.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you want to use numbers as a label in the graph, you need to wrap the text in quote marks.</p>

<h4 id="working-with-a-spreadsheet">Working with a Spreadsheet</h4>

<p>Typing your data manually is fine if it‚Äôs a small graph as shown above. If you have something more intricate, it‚Äôs better to have your data in a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>Clicking on the Import Data button in the data window rarely yields satisfactory results.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="graph-spreadsheet" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-spreadsheet.jpg" /></p>

<div class="fs15 textcenter">
<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-1PeqKm-lULLPUhLXgd6nXEKY42k2C9M1-ls_r2NGcY/edit?usp=sharing" title="Copy the spreadsheet data" target="_blank" class="limegreen">Spreadsheet Data</a>
</div>

<p>It‚Äôs best to open the spreadsheet to copy/paste the data into the Graph Data Table. You can then click the Apply button (check mark). The graph will be drawn on the artboard. If things don‚Äôt look right, click the Revert button. Fix your data file and try again.</p>

<p>You can edit the text in the graph at any point. Simply select it with the Group Selection Tool. Change the text formatting until you are satisfied.</p>

<p>To go back to make changes to the graph, select it with the selection tool and double-click on the graph tool. You can also control-click on it and make various changes.</p>

<p>You can make two types of graphs in one. To do so, select on of the data sets with the Group Selection tool. Double-click on the graph tool and select the desired type of graph from the icons from the dialogue.</p>

<h4 id="graph-designs">Graph Designs</h4>

<p>Let‚Äôs start by building our graph before we enhance it with graph designs</p>

<div class="fs15 textcenter">

<p>Illustrator Graphs really come to life when you replace the bland, greyscale shapes with novel designs. you need to define your design first. Go <span class="command">Object &gt; Graph &gt; Design‚Ä¶</span></p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="graph-design" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-design.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once you define your design, you need to select a data set to apply the design to. Use the Group Selection Tool. Once it‚Äôs selected, go Object &gt; Graph &gt; Column‚Ä¶ Choose the settings which suit your graph design.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="graph-column-design" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-column-design.jpg" /></p>

<p>You actually have quite fine control of how the design can stretch. You can determine which portion of the column stretches using guides.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="graph-sliding-column-design" src="/images/illustrator-graphs/graph-sliding-column-design.jpg" /></p>

<p>Draw lines where you want the graph to stretch. Convert them to guides using <span class="command">‚åò-5</span>. Make sure the guides are unlocked by hitting <span class="command">Option-‚åò-;</span>. Create a new graph design with it set to Sliding, as shown.</p>

<h4 id="outlining-your-graph">Outlining Your Graph</h4>

<p>When you place an Illustrator graph in an InDesign document, you need to ensure it no longer has depencies on fonts or images.</p>

<p>In a duplicate of your graph file, select your graph and ungroup it with Shift-‚åò-G. Illustrator will put up a warning. Click <span class="command">OK</span>. Outline all type by using Shift-‚åò-o or <span class="command">Type &gt; Create Outlines</span>.</p>

<p>Make sure to check your Links panel in Illustrator <span class="command">Window &gt; Links</span> to ensure it‚Äôs empty. If it‚Äôs not, delete any placed images from your file.</p>

<p>You can also check the Find Font dialogue to ensure there‚Äôs no live type in your Illustrator document. If so, outline it using <span class="command">Type &gt; Create Outlines</span>.</p>
