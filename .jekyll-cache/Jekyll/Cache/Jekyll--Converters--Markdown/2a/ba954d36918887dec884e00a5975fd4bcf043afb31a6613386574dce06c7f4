<h3 id="basic-symbols">Basic Symbols</h3>

<p>Draw your own original symbols on the provided map. You should have an icon for:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Camp grounds</li>
  <li>Picnic grounds</li>
  <li>A hospital</li>
  <li>Bicycle paths</li>
  <li>Walking paths</li>

<p>Make one of the icons a dynamic symbol. Change the colours of the instances. In my case, I changed the colour of the picnic grounds icons.</p>

<h3 id="9-slice-scaling">9-Slice Scaling</h3>

<p>In the second instance, the arrow art has already been drawn for you. What you need to do is make it a symbol with 9-slice scaling. You want to make only the wood shaft scale, as shown.</p>
