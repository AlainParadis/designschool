<p>Have you ever wondered why InDesign has two rectangle tools? Well, I have. Theyâ€™re really kind of redundant.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="Vector Rectangle Tools" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-rectangle-tools.svg" /></p>

<p>The Rectangle Frame Tool is a container for placing graphics. The Rectangle Tool is the same one as is in Illustrator. Itâ€™s meant for drawing rectangles. The thing is, you can convert one to the other. You can even make either of them a text frame.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
In InDesign, all shapes you draw can be anything: shapes, image frames or text frames.
</div>

<p><img class="size50" alt="indesign-contents-menu" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-contents-menu.jpg" /></p>

<p>Just right-click on any shape. Choose <span class="command">Object &gt; Convertâ€¦</span> Select either Graphic, Text or Unassigned. An Unassigned frame is simply a general purpose box you can use as a graphic in a page layout. Itâ€™s neutral.</p>

<h3 id="corner-shapes">Corner Shapes</h3>

<p>Itâ€™s super easy to edit the shapes of the corners on a rectangle.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="indesign-edit-round-corners" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-edit-round-corners.gif" /></p>

<p>Simply click the Edit Corners control. Yellow diamond-shaped controls will appear. Drag one to edit all corners or hold shift while dragging to edit only that corner.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="indesign-corner-options" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-corner-options.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you want to set corner radius by the numbers, go to the Options Bar. Option-click on the Corner Options widget to open the Corner Options dialogue.</p>

<h3 id="step--repeat">Step &amp; Repeat</h3>

<p>In Illustrator, if you wish to repeat the last move or copy you performed, youâ€™d hit âŒ˜-D. InDesign has a wonderful feature called Step &amp; Repeat that does just that. Hit <span class="command">Option-âŒ˜-U</span> to invoke the dialogue.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="indesign-step-and-repeat" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-step-and-repeat.jpg" /></p>

<p>The functionality is really versatile. Itâ€™s a great tool for creating equally spaced objects.</p>

<h3 id="the-pen-tool">The Pen Tool</h3>

<p>Hereâ€™s a revelation. In my opinion, the Pen Tool in InDesign is superior to the one in Illustrator. It works exactly the same way, but I find it more accurate.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="indesign-pen-tool-paths" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-pen-tool-paths.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use all the same techniques <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/pen-tool.html" target="_blank" title="Illustrator's Pen Tool is so old-school.">youâ€™ve learned</a> in Illustrator with the Pen Tool in InDesign.</p>

<h3 id="pathfinder">Pathfinder</h3>

<p>InDesign has a very versatile Pathfinder panel. It can help you build shapes based on other shapes.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="indesign-convert-vector-shapes" src="/images/indesign-vector-drawing/indesign-convert-vector-shapes.gif" /></p>

<p>The basic Pathfinder operations work the same in InDesign as they do in Illustrator. The panel does contain more functions, though.</p>
