<p>It’s your job to formulate the questions to be as clear as possible. There isn’t too much editing to do. There are a few questions that could stand some clarification. The bigger challenge is to decide which field type you will use in for each question.</p>

<p>Limit your font and colour usage as much as possible. Build it on a letter-sized sheet.</p>

<p>Save your document the usual way:</p>

<div class="attentionbox filename">
  Appleseed, Johnny, Group #, Form Design.indd
</div>

<p>Once you’re done, use the <span class="command">File &gt; Package…</span> feature to gather assets related to the file. Because you’ve only used Adobe Fonts, there will be no fonts in the package folder.</p>

<p><mark>Add your fillable form PDF file to the folder.</mark> Replace the existing PDF, if there is one in the folder.</p>

<p>Make sure the folder is named properly before you zip-compress it. Submit it on <a href="https://brightspace.algonquincollege.com/d2l/home" title="Submit on Brightspace" target="_blank">Brightspace</a>.</p>

<h3 id="send-for-signature">Send for Signature</h3>

<p>In addition to submitting your assignment on Brightspace, you’ll send it to me filled in and signed.</p>

<p><img class="size33" alt="acrobat-forms-fill-and-sign" src="/images/acrobat-forms/acrobat-forms-fill-and-sign.jpg" /></p>

<p>Fill out your own form as if you were the respondent. Sign it once you’re done. Use the Send and Track functionality to send it to my email address.</p>

<p><img class="size33" alt="acrobat-forms-send-and-track" src="/images/acrobat-forms/acrobat-forms-send-and-track.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once you hit <span class="command">Send and Track</span>, all you need to do is choose to <span class="command">Send Personalized Invitations</span>.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="acrobat-forms-send-track-form" src="/images/acrobat-forms/acrobat-forms-send-track-form.jpg" /></p>

<p>Enter the e-mail address, then fill in the message fields. Once you’re done, click <span class="command">Send</span>.</p>
