I"‡<p>Believe it or not, Photoshop blend modes are pretty cool. Just take a look at this.</p>

<h3 id="important-keyboard-shortcuts">Important Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>These keyboard shortcuts should be committed to memory. Theyâ€™ll help you with this assignment and all the rest of your Photoshop work, especially when youâ€™re working with layer masks.</p>

<p>D: Set foreground &amp; background swatches to default colours, black &amp; white.</p>

<p>X: Switch focus of foreground/background colours.</p>

<p>âŒ˜-Delete: Fill with background colour.</p>

<p>Option-Delete: Fill with foreground colour.</p>

<p>B: Brush Tool. Right-click with Brush tool for controls.</p>

<p>[ Â   or Â  ] : Make brush smaller or bigger.</p>

<h3 id="blending-basics">Blending Basics</h3>

<h4 id="opacity">Opacity</h4>

<p>Opacity is the most basic type of blending. If you reduce the opacity of a layer, it blends with the layer(s) below.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size33" alt="photoshop-opacity-shortcuts" src="/images/photoshop-blend-modes/photoshop-opacity-shortcuts.gif" />
<figcaption>
  Change the opacity of a layer by typing a number. 5 equals 50%. 55 equals 55% opacity.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4 id="blend-modes">Blend Modes</h4>

<p>Youâ€™ll find, as you navigate through Photoshop, youâ€™ll encounter Blend Modes menues everywhere. As you create new layers, thereâ€™s an option to choose a blend mode. There are blend modes for individual painting tools, too. Theyâ€™re everywhere.</p>

<p>The modes available from the Blend Modes menu determine how a layer blends with a layer below. The painting tools also have their own blend modes. That means that you can paint on a layer with a tool in a certain blend mode, while the current layer can have a different blend mode.</p>

<div class="attentionbox shortcut">
  While you have the Move Tool active, you can use Shift with + or - to cycle through the Blend Modes menu.
</div>

<p>There are three blend modes that you really need to know:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Screen</dt>
  <dd>Ignores black. Light pixels get lighter. Itâ€™s like aiming two projectors at the same spot. The dark pixels cancel each other out. The lighter pixels get lighter.</dd>
  <dt>Multiply</dt>
  <dd>Ignores white. It makes things darker. Itâ€™s like stacking two coloured transparencies on top of each other. The darks get darker.</dd>
  <dt>Overlay</dt>
  <dd>It ignores grey. This is a combination fo Screen and Multiply. It increases contrast.</dd>
</dl>

  This is a quick Blend Modes explainer. It covers the essentials.

</figure>

<p>Open the provided file. Test switching the blend modes for each of the grey, black or white bars. This will help you understand the main categories of blend modes.</p>

<p>You can make tonal adjustments in a non-destructive workflow by using blend modes. Letâ€™s fix a photo using this technique.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="tonal-corrections-with-blend-modes" src="/images/photoshop-blend-modes/tonal-corrections-with-blend-modes.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  In this photo, we've used the Screen blend mode to lighten areas of the photo.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All we need to do to lighten the dark leaves is to duplicate the original layer. Set its blend mode to <span class="command">Screen</span>. Mask out the parts of the photo you donâ€™t want to be lightened.</p>

<p>To darken over-exposed areas, duplicate the original layer again. Set the new layer to <span class="command">Multiply</span>. Mask out the area of the photo you donâ€™t want darkened.</p>

<h4 id="lens-flare">Lens Flare</h4>

<p>We can use blend modes to make the most of the lens flare filter.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="photoshop-lens-flare" src="/images/photoshop-blend-modes/photoshop-lens-flare.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Blend modes can assist in using filters like Lens Flare.
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Create a new layer above your photo. Fill it with black by hitting D, then <span class="command">Option-Delete</span>. Use <span class="command">Filter &gt; Render Lens Flareâ€¦</span>. Change the blend mode of the black layer to <span class="command">Screen</span>.</p>

<h4 id="sharpening">Sharpening</h4>

<p>You can even use a blend mode to sharpen a blurry photo. Sharpening with this method is a non-destructive and subtle way to apply sharpening.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="photoshop-sharpen-with-high-pass" src="/images/photoshop-blend-modes/photoshop-sharpen-with-high-pass.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  See the difference between the left and the right sides of this photo? It's subtle sharpening.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<ol>
  <li>Duplicate the layer you want to sharpen with <span class="command">Option-Command-J</span>.</li>
  <li>Name the new layer. Right-click on the new layer, then choose <span class="command">Convert to Smart Object</span>.</li>
  <li>Now use <span class="command">Filter &gt; Other &gt; High Passâ€¦</span>.</li>
  <li>Set the number as high as you can without showing colour through the grey.</li>
  <li>Change the grey layerâ€™s blend mode to <span class="command">Overlay</span>.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you need to sharpen more or less, simply double-click on the High Pass entry in the Layers panel to edit its value.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  Let's set up an automated workflow so we don't forget these steps in the future.
</div>

<h4 id="softening">Softening</h4>

<p>Now, allow me to blow your mind further. You can use the same technique to create the opposite effect. Rather than sharpening, you can smooth/blur areas very gently.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="photoshop-smooth-skin-with-high-pass" src="/images/photoshop-blend-modes/photoshop-smooth-skin-with-high-pass.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  Invert the grey layer to create a subtle smoothing effect.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>All you need to do is invert the grey layer with <span class="command">âŒ˜-i</span>. This will have a smoothing effect. All you need to do is mask areas you donâ€™t want smoothed.</p>

<h3 id="blend-if">Blend If</h3>

<p>Blend If functionality is accessed in a layerâ€™s blending options. You can access this from the <em>fx</em> button at the bottom of the Layers panel or by double-clicking on a layerâ€™s icon. At the bottom of the Blending Options dialogue, youâ€™ll see the the Blend If controls.</p>
