I"P<p>Use a two-point perspective to draw a building. Download a photo of a building. Place it in Illustrator. Lock it on a layer. Create a new layer to draw on. You could always place the building on top, then make it translucent. It can be a corner store, a school, an appartment building, etcâ€¦</p>

<p>These are the criteria for your building:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Use a two-point perspective</li>
  <li>Draw at least some of the ground surface around the building.</li>
  <li>Use type in perspective somewhere in your work. Only use Adobe Fonts.</li>
  <li>Create a symbol for repeating objects, like windows and doors.</li>
</ul>
