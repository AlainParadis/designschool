I"<p>Food identity design is a prime example of the use of stacked appearance attributes. See the examples below. See how the brand names have multiple strokes and fills with gradients? This is what we’re aiming to create.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="illustrator-appearance-example-packaging" src="/images/illustrator-appearance-graphic-styles/illustrator-appearance-example-packaging.jpg" /></p>

<p>Create your own custom food brand. Don’t use an existing name. You can create one that’s an offshoot of a name. Make the artwork unique and your own. Choose fonts only from Adobe Fonts. Create a letter-sized Illustrator document in the appropriate orientation for your brand.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts" title="Go to Adobe Fonts to activate your font." target="_blank">Adobe Fonts</a> to activate the font for your brand. The point is to work with Appearances and Graphic Styles.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="illustrator-appearance-my-example" src="/images/illustrator-appearance-graphic-styles/illustrator-appearance-my-example.jpg" /></p>

<p>In my example above, you can see that I left progressive versions as I worked. What you need to do is keep your wordmark with all its properties in the Appearance Panel. In the end, the wordmark needed to be expanded to achieve the final look. You can do this too. Do it only at the end and only if necessary.</p>

<p>In your file, you may end up with only one piece of artwork, if expanding isn’t necessary. If it becomes necessary, keep a live copy and an expanded copy.</p>
