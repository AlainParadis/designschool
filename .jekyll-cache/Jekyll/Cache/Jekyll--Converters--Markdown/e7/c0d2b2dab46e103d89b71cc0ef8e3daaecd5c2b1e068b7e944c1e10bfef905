I"ž	<p>You will draw a character and render it using your own custom brushes in Illustrator.</p>

<p>The first step in starting your final assignment is to decide what youâ€™re going to draw. You have the choice of character faces. It can be human or animal. They should be very distinctive. These are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A caricature of yourself or someone close to you.</li>
  <li>A little girl in pink</li>
  <li>A stern looking business man</li>
  <li>The bully</li>
  <li>The hipster</li>
  <li>Dizzy guy (just got knocked on the head)</li>
  <li>Goth girl</li>
  <li>Tech support nerd</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a simple pencil sketch of your concept. You can actually scan it, then place it in Illustrator to trace it. This will be the base of your final illustration.</p>

<h3 id="scope-of-work">Scope of Work</h3>

<p>These files are quite demanding in Illustrator. Youâ€™ll want to create a beautiful, polished piece. On the flip-side, you donâ€™t want it to be too detailed. Youâ€™ll need to create a simple, basic sketch, then go to town on the layering of the strokes. The stokes alone will make your file complex enough.</p>

<h3 id="protect-your-files">Protect Your Files</h3>

<p>Painting with such complex brushes is very demanding on Illustrator. These are some tips to make sure you donâ€™t lose any work.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work on a computer thatâ€™s being backed up with Time Machine.</li>
  <li>Work in a cloud-synced folder, like DropBox.com or Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Save really often.</li>
  <li>Create versions of your file by using Save Asâ€¦
    <ul>
      <li>Save Asâ€¦ Appleseed, Johnny, Group 1, Paint <strong>v1</strong>.ai</li>
      <li>Save Asâ€¦ Appleseed, Johnny, Group 1, Paint <strong>v2</strong>.ai</li>
      <li>Save Asâ€¦ Appleseed, Johnny, Group 1, Paint <strong>v3</strong>.ai</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This way, if ever your file gets corrupted, you can revert back to the previous version. You wonâ€™t lose all of your work.</p>
