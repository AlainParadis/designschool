<p>Tabs are flexible spaces used within blocks of text, not at their edges.</p>

<figcaption>
  Since a tab is a flexible space, there's no need to use more than one at a time.

<figcaption>
  Avoid using more than one tab character.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Rather than hitting the Tab key repeatedly, just use one, then set its width in the Tabs ruler.</p>

<h4 id="tables-built-with-tabs">Tables Built with Tabs</h4>

<p>If you type Tab characters at the right places in the text, you can build tables with nicely-spaced columns.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/images/indesign-tabs-and-indents/indesign-table-with-tabs.jpg" class="size100 borderlightgrey1" alt="Table built with Tabs." />
  <figcaption>
    This is a table built with tabs.

<h4 id="fancy-tabs">Fancy Tabs</h4>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="indesign-tab-leaders" src="/images/indesign-tabs-and-indents/indesign-tab-leaders.svg" />
<figcaption>
  A leader is a character that repeats itself where the tab character is.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Above, Iâ€™ve typed a Space character, then a period in the Tab panelâ€™s Leader field. You see that the periods repeat as long as the tab is. Iâ€™ve made them lime green by applying a character style to the tab.</p>

<p>You can also do fancy stuff like lining up a specific character to a tab.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="indesign-tabs-align-on" src="/images/indesign-tabs-and-indents/indesign-tabs-align-on.svg" />
<figcaption>
  See how you can align a on a specific character with a tab.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the text above, the dollar amounts all line up on the decimal mark. This makes rows of money values much easier to read. You can actually align a tab with any character, using the Align On field in the Tabs panel. On the right, all the @ symbols line up.</p>

<h3 id="indents">Indents</h3>

<p>Tabs and indents are useful for setting spacing in blocks or lines of type. Itâ€™s important to know when to use which.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  Indent settings are meant to be used along margins.
</div>

<figcaption>
  Left indents move the text away from the margin. Negative indents make the text hang.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Indent settings are used to push text away from the margins. You can push the whole paragraph away from the margin, or you can do fun stuff as shown above. You can enter negative values to make text hang.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve seldom found a use for right indents on paragraphs. It happens, but rarely.</p>
