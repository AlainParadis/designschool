I"æ<p>Create a letter, portrait page.</p>

<p>On it, you will draw an original sugar skull design using the tools weâ€™ve learned in Illustrator to date. For those of you who donâ€™t know what a Sugar Skull is, these are they:</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="sugar-skull-examples" src="/images/illustrator-draw-new-tools/sugar-skull-examples.jpg" /></p>

<p>Weâ€™ll go beyond what we see here. Weâ€™ll want to make use of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Curvature Pen tool</li>
  <li>The Shape Builder tool</li>
  <li>The Shaper tool</li>
  <li>The Blob Brush</li>
  <li>The Pencil tool</li>
  <li>Variable-Width paths</li>
  <li>Appearance &amp; Graphic Styles</li>
  <li>Patterns</li>
  <li>Gradients or Blends</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, youâ€™ll draw this freehand in Illustrator so it has a very organic look. Yours will be in colour. Note the symmetry they all share.</p>

<p>Feel free to use the Appearance panel and transforms to create and maintain symmetry. Make sure to not expand effects.</p>

<p>Usually, we want all paths to be closed. In this case, there are some circumstances when they wonâ€™t be.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="open-path" src="/images/illustrator-draw-new-tools/open-path.jpg" /></p>

<p>When you use the Pencil tool or the Curvature tool, you may leave paths open, then apply a variable-width stroke to create a shape.</p>

<p>Once youâ€™re done, make sure your document is properly named. If you have artwork on the pasteboard, make sure to save it on a hidden layer called Scraps.</p>
