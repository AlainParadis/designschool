<p>In our first mockup, we want to place artwork on the screen of an iPad. We have the photo of the iPad, then we have a separate .psd of a poster weâ€™ve designed. To place artwork on a device screen, follow the steps below.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-mockup-process" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/photoshop-mockup-process.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can use any of the transform types shown in step 3. Whatever works for your circumstances. In step #5, you should detach the mask from the image by deactivating the chain-link icon in the Layers panel. This allows us to move the artwork separately inside the mask for proper positioning.</p>

<h3 id="our-first-fabric-mockup">Our First Fabric Mockup</h3>

<p>In order to make artwork conform to the wavy shape and texture of of a fabric, we need to use Photoshopâ€™s Displace filter.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="photoshop-displace-original-burlap" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-original-burlap.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is our original untouched image that weâ€™ll map the logo to.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="photoshop-displace-bw-adjustment-layer" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-bw-adjustment-layer.jpg" /></p>

<p>We need to create a greyscale version of the burlap to use as a bump map. The best way to do this is to create a Black and White Adjustment Layer. Usually the Infrared setting gives you the highest contrast. If it doesnâ€™t work for you, choose another preset. Weâ€™re looking for the whitest whites and the darkest blacks possible.</p>

<p><img class="size33" alt="photoshop-displace-convert-to-grey" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-convert-to-grey.jpg" /></p>

<p>Convert your file to greyscale mode. Photoshop will ask you to flatten layers and discard colours. Itâ€™s all good. Weâ€™re going to discard these changes anyways.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="photoshop-displace-save-a-copy-in-grey" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-save-a-copy-in-grey.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use <span class="command">Save Asâ€¦</span>, then make sure that <span class="command">As a Copy</span> is checked so that it spawns a second copy of the file. This will leave the original file untouched. We wouldnâ€™t want to convert our original file. Once youâ€™ve done this, undo back to the colour version of the file.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="photoshop-displace-drag-in-vector-file" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-drag-in-vector-file.jpg" /></p>

<p>Drag any file from Finder into your Photoshop canvas. You can also use <span class="command">File &gt; Place Embeddedâ€¦</span> to import artwork to map to the background texture. Either way, these methods create a Smart Object.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="photoshop-displace-filter-displace" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-filter-displace.jpg" /></p>

<p>The Displace filter makes our logo inherit the texture of the bump map we give it.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="photoshop-displace-filter-settings" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-filter-settings.jpg" /></p>

<p>The settings you enter in the Displace filter really depend on the resoution of your file. Notice that the number doesnâ€™t even have a unit of measure. Itâ€™s not pixels or percent. Weâ€™re going olâ€™ school here. Givâ€™er a number. Take a guess. This is exactly why weâ€™re using a Smart Object. It allows us to go back into the settings to make the effect look just right.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-displace-final" src="/images/photoshop-mockups/displace/photoshop-displace-final.jpg" /></p>

<p>We can finish this off by changing the blend mode for the logoâ€™s layer. In this case, the logoâ€™s black on a lighter backgroud, so the Overlay blend mode works pretty well.</p>

<p>If you want to add a colour to the logo, use a <span class="command">Colour Overlay</span> Layer Effect.</p>
