I"»<p>Photoshop layers are like sheets of stacked acetate. You can see through transparent areas of a layer to the layers below. You move a layer in the Layers panel stacking order to position the content on the layer, like sliding a sheet of acetate in a stack. You can also change the opacity of a layer to make content partially transparent.</p>

<p>The Layers panel is dense with buttons, sliders and other controls. Weâ€™ll explore these in class. Layers can be locked in five different ways, like locking transparency, locking position and more.</p>

<p>Layer organization and stacking order is a whole other area to master. Naming layers is important for your own work and even more for collaboration. <a href="https://photoshopetiquette.com">This is a must-read</a> if you want to respect industry-standard Photoshop etiquette.</p>

<h3 id="filter-layers">Filter Layers</h3>

<figure>

<figcaption>
  <ol>
    <li>Pick a filter type</li>
    <li>Filter for pixel layers</li>
    <li>Filter for Adjustment Layers</li>
    <li>Filter for type Layers</li>
    <li>Filter for shape Layers</li>
    <li>Filter for Smart Objects</li>
    <li>Turn filtering on/off</li>
  </ol>
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These buttons are especially useful when you have a large number of layers in your Photoshop file. You can click one of them to see only that type of layer. As an example, you can vew only Adjustment Layers.</p>

<p>This doesnâ€™t turn on/off the visibility on the canvas. It only filters the layers in the panel.</p>

<h3 id="blend-modes">Blend Modes</h3>

<p><img class="size33" alt="photoshop-blend-modes-panel" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-blend-modes-panel.jpg" /></p>

<p>Blend Modes determine how the pixels on a layer above mix with pixels on the layer below. They can also be used with an individual tool. So, you can brush in a specific blend mode. <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/using/blending-modes.html" title="Adobe's Blend Mode descriptions" target="_blank">This is Adobeâ€™s detailed descriptions</a> of each Blend Mode.</p>

<h3 id="locks">Locks</h3>

<p><img class="size33" alt="photoshop-layers-locks" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-layers-locks.jpg" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Lock transparent pixels: When you paint, only pixels get painted. Transparency isnâ€™t affected.</li>
  <li>Lock pixels: Where there are pixels, you canâ€™t paint. You <em>can</em> move them.</li>
  <li>Lock position: You canâ€™t move things with the Move Tool. You <em>can</em> paint them.</li>
  <li>Artboards: Prevent auto-nesting into and out of Artboards.</li>
  <li>Lock everything: You canâ€™t paint or move anything.</li>
</ol>

<p>These locks are different from the one at the bottom of the Layers panel. These lock the ability to move or paint a layer. The chain link at the bottom of the panel <em>link</em> layers together so them move together.</p>

<h3 id="opacity--fill">Opacity &amp; Fill</h3>

<p><img class="size33" alt="photoshop-layers-panel-opacity-fill" src="/images/photoshop-layers/photoshop-layers-panel-opacity-fill.jpg" /></p>

<p>Opacity is transparency. Lower it and the contents of the whole layer become translucent or transparent.</p>

<p>Fill mostly works exactly like the Opacity control. The major difference is that it doesnâ€™t affect effects. So, if you have Fill set to 0, the photo will disappear, but its Drop Shadow will show.</p>

<figcaption>
  <ol>
    <li>Lock layers so they move together with the move tool. This doesn't prevent them from being painted on.</li>
    <li>Layer Effects, like *Drop Shadow*.</li>
    <li>Add a Layer Mask.</li>
    <li>Add Adjustment Layers.</li>
    <li>Create Layer Groups. These are folders to organize your layers.</li>
    <li>Create a new Layer. Option-click on it to name the layer on creation.</li>
    <li>Delete a layer. You can also simply target the layer, then use the Delete key.</li>
  </ol>

<h3 id="lets-practice">Letâ€™s Practice</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s use each one of these types of layers. Create a new document, then add guides on your canvas with <span class="command">View &gt; New Guide Layout..</span></p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="layers-practice-new-document-setup" src="/images/photoshop-layers/layers-practice-new-document-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>Use the guide below to build the layout as shown. Start by dragging each of the provided photos from the Finder into your Photoshop canvas.</p>
