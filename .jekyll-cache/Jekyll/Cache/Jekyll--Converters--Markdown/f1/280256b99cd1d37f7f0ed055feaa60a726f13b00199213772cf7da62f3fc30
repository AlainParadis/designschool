<p>You donâ€™t have an employee on which you can hand off tedious tasks like renaming hundreds of files or resizing a folder full of images. Well, actually now you do have one. Otto will save time and he wonâ€™t make any mistakes.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="automator-meet-otto" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-meet-otto.jpg" /></p>

<p>The Automator app creates documents. Each time you go <span class="command">File &gt; New</span>, it will create a new document, then ask you what type of automation you wish to create. This is what this looks like.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-new-document" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-new-document.jpg" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Library: These are the areas that Automator can automate.</li>
  <li>Actions: These are all the actions Automator can do.</li>
  <li>Types: These are the different types of automations.</li>
  <li>Workflow: This is where you stack actions so that they run sequentially.</li>
  <li>Description: This is where Automator describes the action youâ€™ve targeted.</li>
  <li>Log or Variables: This area displays a log of your workflow after it has run. Itâ€™s also the variables area.</li>
</ol>

<p>To create a workflow, drag one or more actions into the workflow pane. The order in which you stack them counts because one action feeds the next. If your workflow doesnâ€™t work, there will be an error message in the Log pane at the bottom of the window.</p>

<h4 id="types-of-automations">Types of Automations</h4>

<dl>
  <dt>Workflows:</dt>
  <dd>These are the simplest types of automation. Simply drag actions into the workflow pane, then click the <span class="command">Run</span> button.</dd>
  <dt>Application:</dt>
  <dd>This creates a macOS application from your workflow. You double-click on its icon like any other app and your workflow will run.</dd>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
If you discover that you've chosen the wrong type of automation, you can always change it after the fact by going <span class="command">File &gt; Convert To...</span>, then choose the type you want.

<h3 id="a-simple-workflow">A Simple Workflow</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s rename a large number of files using a simple workflow. Launch Automator, then choose to create a new workflow. Save it into the provided <span class="command">01-simple-workflow</span> folder named <em>Rename Finder Items.workflow</em>.</p>

<p><img class="size15" alt="automator-workflow-icon" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-workflow-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>All you need to do is drag all the provided files into the workflow pane for Automator to act only on these files. It will add its own <span class="command">Get Specified Items</span> action.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-workflow-rename-finder-items" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-workflow-rename-finder-items.jpg" /></p>

<p>Do a search for <em>rename</em>. Drag the <span class="command">Rename Finder Items</span> action into your workflow. Set it up as shown above. This means youâ€™ll drag it in a few times. You can see that weâ€™re going to make the file names lower case. Weâ€™ll replace all spaces and underscores with hyphens.</p>

<p>So, this</p>

<p>Text File 31.txt</p>

<p>will become this</p>

<p>text-file-31.txt.</p>

<p>Do you see how this could be useful for web design? All your web site pages and images should be named without spaces and all lower case. Now you donâ€™t need to do this manually anymore. Otto can act on many files at once for you.</p>

<p>Save this workflow file into the <span class="command">01-simple-workflow</span> folder named <em>Rename Finder Items.workflow</em>.</p>

<h3 id="a-finder-service">A Finder Service</h3>

<p><img class="size15" alt="automator-finder-service-icon" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-finder-service-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>The above workflow is all well and good, but itâ€™s quite a bit of work to create such a workflow each time you want to rename files and folders. To this end, weâ€™ll create a <em>Finder Service</em>.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s create a Finder Service which we can envoke with a right-click in Finder. Weâ€™ll make it a workflow that we can have rename files and folders however we want.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-finder-service" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-finder-service.jpg" /></p>

<p>Save this file as <span class="command">Rename Finder Items</span>. You donâ€™t choose the location where itâ€™s saved. All Finder Services are stored in <span class="command">Home Directory &gt; Library &gt; Services</span>. If you need to edit your service, you can find it there, then open to edit.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-finder-services-finder-menu" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-finder-services-finder-menu.jpg" /></p>

<p>To envoke the action, simply right-click on files and/or folders in Finder. Go <span class="command">Services &gt; Rename Finder Items</span>. The beauty of this is that the action asks you how you want to rename the selected files. The action asks because youâ€™ve checked <span class="command">Show this action when the workflow runs</span> when you created the service.</p>

<h3 id="make-web-friendly-service">Make Web Friendly Service</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s make a <em>Make Web-Friendly</em> service so you can quickly renamed batches of files for your web dev projects. Create a new Automator document. Add these actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rename Finder Items: Replace a Space character with a hyphen.</li>
  <li>Rename Finder Items: Replace and Underscore character with a hyphen.</li>
  <li>Rename Finder Items: Make the whole file name lower case.</li>
</ol>

<p>Save the Automator document as Make Web-Friendly. Now, when you need to rename a batch of files or folders, you can do it with a right-click.</p>

<h3 id="a-folder-action">A Folder Action</h3>

<p><img class="size15" alt="automator-folder-action-icon" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-folder-action-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can create an Automator workflow, then attach it to a specific folder. When you add files to the folder, the action does its thing.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
Folder Actions are stored here: <span class="command">/Users/*username*/Library/Workflows/Applications/</span>
</div>

<p>Letâ€™s create an workflow which will resize images. The workflow is meant for really large image files which you want to make smaller to post online or send via e-mail.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-folder-action-resize-images" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-folder-action-resize-images.jpg" /></p>

<p><mark>Note that this workflow is destructive.</mark> Itâ€™s going to resize the originals of any images you put in the folder. Point the action to the provided 02-images-to-1500px folder. Copy the provided images into that folder, then watch the magic happen. All images copied into this folder will be resized to 1500 pixels wide. <em>-1550px</em> will be appended to the file names, then they get moved to the 03-processed-images folder.</p>

<p>You can edit a Folder Action after the fact by right-clicking on the folder itself.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="automator-edit-folder-action" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-edit-folder-action.jpg" /></p>

<p>On the left is a list of folders on your computer which have actions attached to them. On the right is a list of all the folder actions youâ€™ve created.</p>

<h3 id="a-calendar-action">A Calendar Action</h3>

<p><img class="size15" alt="automator-calendar-action-icon" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-calendar-action-icon.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can create a workflow, then have it triggered by a calendar event. Letâ€™s set up a backup schedule for a specific folder. This workflow will copy a folder from one place to another daily.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
Calendar Actions are stored here: <span class="command">/Users/*username*/Library/Workflows/Applications/</span>
</div>

<p><img class="size100" alt="automator-calendar-action" src="/images/macos-automator/automator-calendar-action.jpg" /></p>

<p>As you can see, the workflow copies the files from the original location to the folder called <span class="command">03-backup-destination</span>. Once you save the workflow, the Apple Calendar app launches. It allows you to enter the time and frequency of the backup action.</p>
