<p>Make sure you give yourself <strong>a lot</strong> of time to submit. An hour is <em>not</em> a lot of time. If you can submit the day before the due date, all the better.</p>

<p>Murphyâ€™s Law dictates that your internet connection will fail you when you need it most. <em>Plan for this.</em></p>

<p>Itâ€™s advisable to carry <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=ethernet+cable&amp;bext=msl&amp;atb=v31-3__&amp;iax=1&amp;ia=images" title="Ethernet cable" target="_blank">an ethernet cable</a> and <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/MD463LL/A/thunderbolt-to-gigabit-ethernet-adapter?fnode=8b&amp;fs=f%3Dadapter%26fh%3D4595%252B45b0" title="Ethernet to Thunderbolt adaptor" target="_blank">an adaptor</a> in your computer bag, so you can use a wired connection at school to transfer large files faster. It will also come to your rescue if the collegeâ€™s Wi-Fi goes down.</p>

<h4 id="submission-page">Submission Page</h4>

<p>To submit an assignment on Brightspace, go to the assignment page. There will be a Submit button at the top-right of the page. There are also details about the assignment, like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Due date</li>
  <li>Point value</li>
  <li>The type of submission</li>
  <li>Submission file type</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="canvas-submission-button" src="/images/general/canvas-submission-button.gif" /></p>

<h4 id="submitting-your-assignment">Submitting Your Assignment</h4>

<p>Start by choosing your submission file. You cannot submit a folder. Brightspace wonâ€™t accept it. In the case pictured below, you need to submit a zip-compressed file.</p>

<p><img alt="canvas-submission-zip-compress" src="/images/general/canvas-submission-zip-compress.gif" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the file</li>
  <li>You can write an optional comment with your assignment submission.</li>
  <li>Click the submission button.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="submitting-in-safari-browser">Submitting in Safari Browser</h3>

<p>When you submit using the Safari browser, the submission button changes to <em>Submittingâ€¦</em> This doesnâ€™t offer a view of the upload progress.</p>

<p><img alt="canvas-submitting-with-safari" src="/images/general/canvas-submitting-with-safari.gif" /></p>

<p>Thereâ€™s no indication of the upload progress in Safari. The upload may have stopped and youâ€™d never know.</p>

<h3 id="submitting-with-google-chrome-browser">Submitting with Google Chrome Browser</h3>

<p>If you use <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html" title="Download Google Chrome Browser" target="_blank">Googleâ€™s Chrome browser</a> to submit files, you get a progress indication at the bottom-left of the window. This way, you can tell if the upload is working.</p>

<h3 id="a-stalled-upload">A Stalled Upload</h3>

<p>In cases where your upload doesnâ€™t advance, take these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Try Google Chrome to monitor the upload progress.</li>
  <li>Log out of Brightspace, then log back in. Try to upload again.</li>
  <li>Check that you have an internet connection. A wired connection will almost always be faster than Wi-Fi.</li>
</ol>

<p>Uploading files from the college campus will likely be faster than uploading from home; especially at off-peak hours.</p>
