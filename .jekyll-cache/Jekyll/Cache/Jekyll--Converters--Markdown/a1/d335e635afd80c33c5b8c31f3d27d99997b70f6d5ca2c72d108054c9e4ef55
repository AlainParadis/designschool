<h4 id="document-creation">Document Creation</h4>

<p>Create a single-page document with 2p0 margins all around. Make sure you adhere to all the settings shown below.</p>

<p><img class="size33" alt="document-setup" src="/images/indesign-vw-layout/document-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>Make sure you save your document like this (with your own name):</p>

<div class="attentionbox filename">
  Appleseed-Johnny-#-VW-layout.indd
</div>

<p>This will make it that your folder will automatically be named properly once youâ€™re done.</p>

<h4 id="setting-base-paragraph-styles">Setting Base Paragraph Styles</h4>

<p>As soon as youâ€™ve created your document, make sure you set your Basic Paragraph Style to Futura PT Book 9pt.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="paragraph-styles-panel" src="/images/indesign-vw-layout/paragraph-styles-panel.jpg" /></p>

<p>Everything thatâ€™s in Futura PT needs to be based on the Basic Paragraph Style.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  Futura PT 9/12 means that it's 9 point type size and 12 point leading. It's expressed <i>nine over twelve</i>.
</div>
