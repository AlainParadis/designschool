I"M<p>There are many great reasons for using Acrobat forms rather than paper forms. First of all, they’re more ecological. It’s a great idea to make Acorbat forms part of a paperless workflow. Respondents don’t need to copy or fax forms. The recipient of the response data gets information which is manipulated much more easily. These are all great benefits of working digitally rather than with paper.</p>

<p>You can use Acrobat forms for such things as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Identification</li>
  <li>Permissions</li>
  <li>Co-op applications</li>
  <li>and much, much more…</li>
</ul>
