<p>A composite is made of a selection of images with a theme. Multiple images are part of a seamless composition.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-our-goals">What Are Our Goals?</h3>

<h4 id="goals-conceptual">Goals, Conceptual</h4>

<p>The goal of this assignment is to have you design a composition with a theme of your choice. You need to use your own photos. The composition can be memories of an event, a person in your life or some other personal topic. Feel free to take photos for this assignment.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  If you have any doubts about your topic, don't hesitate to pass it by me.
</div>

<p>The more specific you are about your theme, the better. For example, rather than simply choosing <em>My Travels</em>, choose <em>The Grand Canyon, 2019</em> . The more specific you are with your choice of concept, the easier it will be for you to design your composition.</p>

<p>Your concept <em>can</em> convey a message. It could be an environmental, anti-gun, pro-Trump (!) or whatever else you can think of. It can be edgy; even controversial. Just keep it decent. The decency test is: <em>would the College allow you to post it on their bulletin boards?</em></p>

<h4 id="goals-technical">Goals, Technical</h4>

<p>One of the principal goals here is to build a file in Photoshop which is easily editable. To this end, you must use most of these features in your file.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Layers</dt>
  <dd>Use layers to organize your work and maintain editability. Make sure you name all of your layers meaningfully.</dd>
  <dt>Layer Masks</dt>
  <dd>Don’t erase. Ever. Use masks to show/hide content. Option-click on the mask to see it. Make sure it’s clean — no <em>crumbs</em> or unnecessary sloppiness.</dd>
  <dt>Blend Modes</dt>
  <dd>These dictate how one layer’s content mixes with the layer(s) below. These can sometimes be used in the place of a lowered opacity setting.</dd>
  <dt>Layer Effects</dt>
  <dd>Examples include drop shadow, colour overlay, and many more. Effects are editable. They’re accessible from the <em>fx</em> button at the bottom of the Layers panel.</dd>
  <dt>Layer Groups</dt>
  <dd>Organize your layers in named folders. Name all folders. Note that you can nest folders.</dd>
  <dt>Masks on Groups</dt>
  <dd>If you wish to mask all content in a group, you an add a mask to a folder.</dd>
  <dt>Effect on Groups</dt>
  <dd>The same goes with Effects. You can apply them to a group.</dd>
  <dt>Blending on Groups</dt>
  <dd>Ditto to Blend Modes.</dd>
  <dt>Adjustment Layers</dt>
  <dd>These are special layers which only hold an instruction to the layer(s) below to change somehow. Make sure to name them by what they do. ie: H/S Make Blue is a Hue/Saturation layer that makes things blue.</dd>
  <dt>Clipping Masks</dt>
  <dd>Clipping masks show pixels on the layer above only where there are pixels below. Option-⌘-G does the trick.</dd>
  <dt>Point Type</dt>
  <dd>Create a meaningful title for your composition. Just click and type. Do not drag a box. Feel free to add Layer Effects, Clipping Masks and the like on your text, but don’t over-do it.</dd>
  <dt>Vector Masks</dt>
  <dd>Vector masks hide content based on a vector path. This makes it that the mask has an absolutely sharp edge. It either hides or reveals. There are no grey areas.</dd>
  <dt>Smart Objects</dt>
  <dd>Use <span class="command">File &gt; Place Embedded…</span> to import a photo as a Smart Object. You can also right-click on a layer, then choose <span class="command">Create Smart Object</span>. This will make that layer scalable without damaging the pixels. Just don’t scale it up much passed 100%.</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="placing-images">Placing Images</h3>

<p>Import images for your composition by using <span class="command">File &gt; Place Embedded…</span>. You can also drag their icons from Finder into you canvas. Do <strong>not</strong> use <span class="command">File &gt; Place Linked…</span></p>

<div class="attentionbox achtung">
  Odds are, your images will start off as .JPEG files. Open them all, then save them as native .PSD files <em>before</em> you import them. It will make them easier to edit once they're in your main composition.
</div>

<h3 id="my-example">My Example</h3>

<p>When I was seventeen, I circumnavigated the globe on a tall ship. These are a few photos from my trip.</p>

<figure>
    <img class="size100" alt="photoshop-compositing-example" src="/images/photoshop-compositing/photoshop-compositing-example.jpg" />
<figcaption>
  This is my example of a Photoshop compositing piece.
</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Note the various techniques used here.</p>

<ul>
  <li> There's a parchment background behind the whole composition to ensure we don't see a transparent or white background.</li>
  <li> The photo of the temple is fades into the Moai photo seemlessly.</li>
  <li> The Moais are masked.</li>
  <li> I'm masked.</li>
  <li> Some photos have a photo frame built with a layer effect.</li>
  <li> The type in the title has a drop shadow to pop it off the photos.</li>
  <li> The overall composition visually revolves from top-left to bottom-right, which is a natural flow, in reading direction.</li>
</ul>

<p>Make sure you achieve definition like this. Avoid making a <em>muddy</em> composition. That’s one where there’s nothing distinct. All the photos just meld together.</p>
