<p>The Gradient Tool is a very powerful one. And with great power comes great responsibility. Weâ€™ll learn to wield it like a true Jedi Master. The danger here is to create muddy colour transitions between our gradient stops. Weâ€™ll build a drawing of a pencil using gradients in class. Once youâ€™re done, youâ€™ll possess secrets of the Gradient Tool.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll explore:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Gradient Panel</li>
  <li>The Gradient Tool</li>
  <li>The Gradient Annotator</li>
  <li>Linear gradients</li>
  <li>Radial gradients</li>
  <li>Freeform gradients</li>
  <li>Gradients on a path</li>
  <li>Selecting colours for tasteful gradients</li>
  <li>Opacity in gradients</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="blends">Blends</h3>

<p>The end-product of a blend can often look like a gradient, but theyâ€™re much more versatile.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can blend objects to create and distribute shapes evenly between two objects. You can also blend between two open paths to create a smooth transition between objects, or you can combine blends of colors and objects to create color transitions in the shape of a particular object.

<p>Weâ€™ll practice creating blends in class, starting with the basics, then move on to more advanced techniques. Weâ€™ll draw a banner like this one, which contains a number of blends. Some are masked. Some are not. Theyâ€™re all stacked to create this wonderful graphic.</p>
