<p>The Graphic Design Program is part of the Collegeâ€™s BYOD program, as such a Macintosh laptop is mandatory equipment. The base model 15â€ MacBook Pro is the minimum required equipment.</p>

<h3 id="why-do-i-need-to-buy-this">Why Do I Need to Buy This?</h3>

<p>A 15â€ MacBook Pro is an industry-standard laptop for graphic designers. Your faculty does their best to prepare you for work in industry. As such, we want you to start using that equipment as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Another reason for this is standardization. Itâ€™s much cleaner to teach a group whoâ€™s all using the same equipment. While teaching, we can point to a feature knowing it will be at the same place for all students. There are no operating system variants, such as Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, etcâ€¦</p>

<h3 id="bring-what-you-got">Bring What You Got</h3>

<p>Some students have a recently purchased laptop. Come to class with what you have, whether itâ€™s a Windows or a macOS model. Youâ€™ll transition to the Mac as soon as itâ€™s you can.</p>

<p>Likewise, if you have an older laptop, bring it to class. Weâ€™ll work with what you have until you can upgrade.</p>

<h3 id="what-to-avoid">What to Avoid</h3>

<p>If you are purchasing a new Mac, avoid the 13â€ MacBook Pro. Itâ€™s a great all-around machine, but its screen is too small for professional design work.</p>

<h3 id="peripherals--more">Peripherals &amp; Moreâ€¦</h3>

<p>You need to come to each class equipped with a mouse and a mouse pad of your choice. If you purchase a new MacBook Pro, Appleâ€™s AppleCare warranty is a good idea, though not mandatory.</p>

<p>It will be useful to bring earphones or headphones to class so you can listen to video tutorials, if needed. Keep them in your bag.</p>

<p>Please allot $50 per year for an online backup service. &lt;a href=â€http://www.backblaze.comâ€ alt:=â€BackBlaze computer cloud backup.â€ target=â€_blankâ€&gt;BackBlaze&lt;/a&gt; is a good one.  Alternatively, you can purchase an external desktop hard drive at approximately $100. Any USB 3 unit at 2TB or above is sufficient. One of the two choices is mandatory.</p>

<p>A basic Wacom drawing tablet (or equivalent) is also a suggested purchase, but not required. Approximate cost is $100.</p>

<p>No printer or scanner is required.</p>
