<p>Create a new document as shown, with 16 facing pages. Note that 16 is divisible by 4. Publications always need to have a number of pages divisible by 4 because one signature has four sides.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="text-variables-document-setup" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-document-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>Double-check that you’ve entered all the other values in the dialogue properly. Once our document is created, we want to edit our base paragraph styles.</p>

<h3 id="paragraph-styles">Paragraph Styles</h3>

<p>Start by opening the Basic Paragraph style. Change your font to <span class="command">Abril Text Regular</span>. You’ll need to <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/abril" target="_blank" title="Activate this font on Adobe Fonts.">activate this on Adobe Fonts</a>. You also need to create a Base Sans paragraph style. Let’s use Proxima Nova Regular. <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/proxima-nova" target="_blank" title="Activate this font on Adobe Fonts.">Go activate it on Adobe Fonts</a>.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="text-variables-base-styles" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-base-styles.jpg" /></p>

<p>The client styled the text in the provided Word document. We’ll use these to style the text automatically. It’s easier to create the appropriate styles in InDesign beforhand. Let’s do that. Create:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Body Copy, based on Basic Paragraph</li>
  <li>Chapter Numbers, based on Base Sans</li>
  <li>Chapter Names, based on Base Sans</li>
  <li>Recipe Names, based on Base Sans</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="master-pages">Master Pages</h3>

<p>Rename A-Master to A-Base. This is the master that will contain any elements which repeat on all pages of the document.</p>

<p>Create a second master called B-Master which is based on A-Base. This will contain all of our content.</p>

<p>See the images just below…</p>

<h3 id="numbering--sections">Numbering &amp; Sections</h3>

<p>We’re going to create sections for our document. The document page numbers will start on the third page. We’ll start by making the pages numbered with lower case roman numberals. Right-click on page one, then choose <span class="command">Numbering &amp; Section Options…</span>. Make the page numbering style roman numberals.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-sections-numbering" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-sections-numbering.jpg" /></p>

<p>Right-click on page three. Go to <span class="command">Numbering &amp; Section Options…</span> Change the numbering style to arabic numerals. Make sure you set the starting numbering to 1.</p>

<h3 id="place-text">Place Text</h3>

<p>Put threaded primary text frames on the <span class="command">B Master</span> pages. Let’s apply the masters from the third page to the last. The best way to do this is select the page icons in the Pages panel, then option-click on the master you want to apply to them.</p>

<p>Use <span class="command">File &gt; Place…</span> to flow the text for chicken, beef and fish recipes. Shift-click on the Open button to access import options shown below.</p>

<p>If your source Word document is formatted with Word text styles, you can map them to existing InDesign styles on import.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="text-variables-style-mapping" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-style-mapping.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="page-folios">Page Folios</h3>

<p>Page folios can be at the top or bottom corners or centers of the pages. They can figure on every page of the publication or change depending on the content. They can include: page numbers, chapter numbers, publication title, section title, story title, issue date, web address and more.</p>

<p>We create them on the Master Page. They should be distinct from text and consistent in appearance. Make them on a new layer so the stacking order can be changed.</p>

<p>Let’s place page numbers on our A-Base. They’ll automatically appear on all pages of our document.</p>

<p><img class="size75" alt="text-variables-folios" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-folios.jpg" /></p>

<p>Let’s type <span class="command">⌘-Option-Shift-N</span> to enter an automatic page number. Create a Paragraph Style called Folio to style it at 9pt Abril Regular. Add an m-dash after the number. You get an m-dash with <span class="command">Shift-Option-hyphen</span>.</p>

<h3 id="footer-text-variables">Footer Text Variables</h3>

<p>We’re going to add content to the footer based on the titles on the pages using Text Variables. We want to more than only a page number in the folio. We want food types and recipe titles. In order to do this, we’ll create and define two text variables.</p>

<p>Let’s go to A-Base.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-text-variable-settings" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-text-variable-settings.jpg" /></p>

<p>After the page number, add — Recipe Name as a custom text variable.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variable-folio" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variable-folio.jpg" /></p>

<p>We’ll also add the chapter name near the spine. Hit Shift-tab to get a right-aligned tab. Add a custom variable for the chapter’s name.</p>

<h3 id="slug-info">Slug Info</h3>

<p>Let’s use our document’s slug area to leave important document information for all collaborators on the document. The information will update automatically.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-slug-variables" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-slug-variables.jpg" /></p>

<p>On A-Base, create new text frame in the Slug area. Don’t touch the bleed with the frame. Create a Paragraph Style for the slug text called <span class="command">Slug Text</span>.</p>

<p>With your cursor in the frame, go <span class="command">Type &gt; Text Variables &gt; Insert Variable &gt; Creation Date</span>. Let’s do this two more times to match the example above. This will keep a good record of the last state of the document for all those contributing to the design.</p>

<h3 id="automatic-story-jumps">Automatic Story Jumps</h3>

<p>When you read a magazine, you often encounter stories that continue on a page further in the publication. It’ll usually says <em>Continued on page x</em>. This is called a Story Jump. InDesign can deal with these automatically.</p>

<p>Create a text frame on one page, then thread it to a second text frame created on another page. Right-click to fill them with <span class="command">Fill with placeholder text</span>.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-story-jump" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-story-jump.jpg" /></p>

<p>To create an automatic story jump, we create a separate text frame. Type the text you want in it, then right-click to choose <span class="command">Insert Special Characters &gt; Markers &gt; Next Page Number</span>. Do the same with <span class="command">Previous Page Number</span>.</p>

<p>The key to making this work is that our story jump text frame physically touches the related text frame.</p>

<h3 id="live-captions">Live Captions</h3>

<p>InDesign is capable of pulling meta-data from a placed photo to use it as a caption. This is really a great solution when you work in a team. The photographer in the field or the photo editor can type a caption in the photo’s meta-data from Photoshop. InDesign will generate a Live Caption based on that meta data automatically on the page.</p>

<p>We need to start with taking on the role of the photographer by adding the meta-data to the photo in Photoshop. Go <span class="command">File &gt; File Info…</span> or <span class="command">Shift-Option-⌘-i</span>. The text would be entered in the Description field and any other field you choose. Lets’ enter:</p>

<p>First image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Title: Roast Chicken with Rosemary</li>
  <li>Description: The rosemary gives it a sweet taste. It blends well with the garlic.</li>
  <li>© Your Full Name, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Second Image:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Document Title: Salsa Chicken</li>
  <li>Description: A household favourite. Use mild, medium or hot salsa depending on your taste.</li>
  <li>© Your Full Name, 2017</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-photoshop-meta-data" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-photoshop-meta-data.jpg" /></p>

<p>In InDesign, we need to set up our captions in <span class="command">Object &gt; Captions &gt; Caption Setup…</span></p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-captions-setup" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-captions-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is where we can choose the meta-data types that were entered back in Photoshop. We can even add text before or after the meta-data. There’s an option to style the captions there too.</p>

<p>To actually create the caption, we select the photo, then go <span class="command">Object &gt; Captions &gt; Generate Live Caption…</span> This will make a new text frame with the meta-data in it, styled with the chosen paragraph style.</p>

<p>We can create a caption which will insert a title for the photo, too.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-caption-image-title" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-caption-image-title.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="tables-of-contents">Tables of Contents</h3>

<p>An InDesign Table of Contents is built based on the Paragraph Style used to style the chapter headings. That’s where it pulls the text from. It’s going to be imperative that your titles have paragraph styles applied.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="text-variables-toc-setup" src="/images/indesign-text-variables/text-variables-toc-setup.jpg" /></p>

<p>We need to also create paragraph styles to style the actual table of contents. Let’s create three levels of styles. One is for the title, the second is for the food types and the third is for the recipies. Remember that we can always edit them after the fact.</p>

<p>You’ll find the options under <span class="command">Layout &gt; Table of Contents…</span>. If you make a change in your text, you can go <span class="command">Layout &gt; Update Table of Contents</span></p>
