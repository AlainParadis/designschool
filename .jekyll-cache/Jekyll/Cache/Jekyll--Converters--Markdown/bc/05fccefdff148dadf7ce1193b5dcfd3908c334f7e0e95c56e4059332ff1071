<p>This page assumes you have Illustrator CC installed on your computer. The next step is to ensure itâ€™s up to date. To do so, go to your Creative Cloude Desktop App icon in your Macâ€™s menu bar.</p>

<p><img class="size50" alt="cc-updates" src="/images/setup-illustrator/illustrator-updates.jpg" /></p>

<p>If one of the buttons is set to Update, then you have an update to apply.</p>

<h3 id="default-document">Default Document</h3>

<p>Before we even launch Illustrator, weâ€™re going to put in place a better default document. Go to this folder on your Mac.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="illustrator-default-document-path" src="/images/setup-illustrator/illustrator-default-document-path.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the folder, thereâ€™s a document named Print.ai. Rename it Print-original.ai. Put the new one into this folder.</p>

<h3 id="keyboard-shortcuts">Keyboard Shortcuts</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s install a better set of keyboard shortcuts. The .kys file is in the folder youâ€™ve downloaded. Move them to this location on your Mac. Go to your Library folder from the Finderâ€™s Go menu.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="illustrator-keyboard-shortcuts" src="/images/setup-illustrator/illustrator-keyboard-shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<p>Weâ€™re never really done setting up Illustrator. I find myself constantly adjusting settings and creating new workspaces. Itâ€™s an ongoing process.</p>

<h3 id="preferences">Preferences</h3>

<p>Before we start to use Illustrator, we want to change a few settings in the application. Go to the Illustrator menu, then choose Preferences. Change Preferences to match whatâ€™s in the provided images.</p>

<p><img alt="illustrator-preferences" src="/images/setup-illustrator/illustrator-preferences.jpg" class="size50" /></p>

<p>Once youâ€™ve made the changes, quit Illustrator so the new settings are written to your hard drive.</p>

<h3 id="workspaces">Workspaces</h3>

<p>By default, Illustrator uses the Application Frame. Itâ€™s a window that contains the whole applicationâ€™s user interface. Itâ€™s very constraining. Letâ€™s get rid of it from the outset. Youâ€™ll see, youâ€™ll be better without it.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">
  Turn off Application Frame from the Window menu
</div>

<p>Illustrator has dozens of panels. Letâ€™s set up so you can have the right panels where you expect them to speed up your work. The best plan is to start with the Essentials workspace.</p>

<p>Go <span class="command">Window &gt; Workspace &gt; New Workspaceâ€¦</span> then name it with your name. Once youâ€™ve done this, it will be your default set of panels.</p>

<p>If you want to add or remove a panel from this set, all you do is make then change, then re-save a new set with the same name. This will over-write your old one.</p>

<p>If you find yourself needing a whole different set of panels for a specific type of work, go ahead and make new a workspace.</p>

<h3 id="guided-tour">Guided Tour</h3>

<p>Now weâ€™re ready to launch Illustrator. The first item on the menu is to take a quick tour of Illustratorâ€™s user interface. Weâ€™ll look at the Control Panel, Tools and Panels setup. Iâ€™ll show you how you can easily switch between open documents and view them in full-screen mode.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="illustrator-setup-panels" src="/images/setup-illustrator/illustrator-setup-panels.jpg" /></p>

<p>With time, youâ€™ll create an working environment in Illustator thatâ€™s all your own.</p>
