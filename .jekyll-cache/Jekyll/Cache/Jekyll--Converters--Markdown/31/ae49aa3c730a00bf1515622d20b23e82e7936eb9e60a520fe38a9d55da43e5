<h4 id="paper-mock-up">Paper Mock-up</h4>

<p>A paper mock-up is the best way to visualize your publication. You can test dimensions, binding and paper stock. This is a fun hands-on paper-craft activity. Use imagination to create a mock-up with design elements that may refer to the content. Maybe a simple die-cut or creative binding could allude to the subject matter.</p>

<p>In industry, you would produce a mock-up thatâ€™s clean enough to show your client. It should be well assembled and represent the final piece as closely as possible.</p>

<p>This is going to dictate the format of the final piece, so take care to think this through. The client expects these details to be delivered in the final product.</p>

<h4 id="typography">Typography</h4>

<p>The type specimen will communicate the typographic treatment in your work.   You should only use two type families in this project, unless you have a specific reason for more. Choose families with a lot of variety; weight, italics, etcâ€¦</p>

<div class="attentionbox achtung">You are only allowed Adobe Fonts for this project. No downloaded fonts allowed.</div>

<p>Build a type specimen document in InDesign. It can be a single page or more, if needed. It will showcase:</p>

<ul>
  <li>font selection</li>
  <li>type treatment
    <ul>
      <li>hierarchy of titles, body copy, photo captions, etcâ€¦</li>
      <li>leading</li>
      <li>space after or first line indent</li>
      <li>colour application</li>
      <li>appearance of captions pull quotes, emphasis, etcâ€¦</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a page layout sample. It will simply include each of the elements on the page. Itâ€™s actually better that itâ€™s not laid-out so that doesnâ€™t distract from the typography.</p>

<p>You can include a grey box as a place-holder for a photo to show what captions look like.</p>

<h4 id="photo-treatment">Photo Treatment</h4>

<p>Your publication should contain a lot of photography, as travel books do. You will source quality stock photography. This is a <a href="/administration/stock.html">good starting point</a> for your search.</p>

<p>Your final photography should have a consistent treatment and style throughout your document. Similar mood, lighting, cropping should be used across the publication. You can vary indoor/outdoor and object/people photography. You can achieve this by using Photoshop.</p>

<div class="attentionbox tip">It's important that a large majority of your photos include people. This brings a lot more life to your publication.</div>

<h5 id="required-photo-montage">Required Photo Montage</h5>

<p>You must include one full-spread photo montage in your publication. It will <em>likely</em> be in the centre-fold. This is the part of the project where youâ€™ll flex your Photoshop muscles.</p>

<p>Create a tabloid-sized page with samples of photo treatments. Also include a sample of what your montage will look like. Also, print a contact sheet of your photo selection.</p>

<h4 id="illustration-samples">Illustration Samples</h4>

<p>Create illustrations to include throughout the document. These can complement the photography and typography. They need to be done in Illustrator, then imported onto the InDesign pages.</p>

<p>Create a layout with samples of your illustrations. Format the page as needed to showcase your illustrations.</p>

<p>You will have at least one info-graphic taking up a minimum of a page or as much as a spread.</p>

<p>You should have other illustrations as page decorations. It might be more convenient to place them on master pages rather than having to position them individually on each page.</p>
