<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-transforms-exercise-1" src="/images/photoshop-transforms/photoshop-transforms-exercise-transform.jpg" /></p>

<p>Open 01-transforms-scale-and-repeat.psd. Perform the transforms on the glass as indicated in the image. You should end up with one glass per layer. Make sure you make each layer a Smart Object to ensure your edits are non-destructive and editable.</p>

<h3 id="warp-transform">Warp Transform</h3>

<p>Open 02-transforms-warp.psd. Use warp envelopes to make the label wrap around the bottle as a Smart Object.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-transforms-exercise-warp" src="/images/photoshop-transforms/photoshop-transforms-exercise-warp.jpg" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there’s a glass layer on top of the layer stack, with a Linear Light blend mode. The label was also made more realistic with gentle Gaussian Blur Smart Filter. Paint on the filter’s mask to edit it.</p>

<h3 id="vanishing-point">Vanishing Point</h3>

<p>Use the Vanishing Point filter to move the banner art onto the wall in perspective.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-transforms-vanishing-exercise" src="/images/photoshop-transforms/photoshop-transforms-exercise-vanishing.jpg" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there’s a drop shadow on the sign. You can access this effect from the <em>fx</em> button at the bottom of the Layers panel.</p>

<h3 id="puppet-warp">Puppet Warp</h3>

<p>Find a photo on which you’ll perform a puppet warp. This could change someone’s facial expression. It could change their stance or body position. Your effect needs to be realistic, obvious and non-destructive.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-transforms-puppet-warp-before-after" src="/images/photoshop-transforms/photoshop-transforms-puppet-warp-before-after.jpg" /></p>

<p>Realistic: This means that we shouldn’t really be able to tell you’ve modified the photo without looking at the original.</p>

<p>Obvious: The edits need to be very obvious when we compare the <em>before</em> and <em>after</em> states.</p>

<p>Non-destructive: Duplicate your subject onto a new layer. Make that duplicate layer a Smart Object. We want to be able to see the <em>before</em> and <em>after</em>. We also want to be able to go back into the warp settings to edit them.</p>

<p>Once you’re done, save and close.</p>

<h3 id="perspective-warp">Perspective Warp</h3>

<p>Open 04-transforms-perspective-warp.psd. Use the Perspective Warp tool to remove the lens distortion on the building, as shown. Make sure you duplicate the building layer, then make it a Smart Object.</p>

<p><img class="size100" alt="photoshop-transforms-perspective-exercise" src="/images/photoshop-transforms/photoshop-transforms-exercise-perspective.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once you’re done, save and close.</p>
