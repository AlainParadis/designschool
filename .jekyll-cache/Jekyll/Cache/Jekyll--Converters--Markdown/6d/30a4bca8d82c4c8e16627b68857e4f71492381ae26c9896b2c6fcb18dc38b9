<p>Itâ€™s a good idea to take notes in class. Itâ€™s even better to have typed notes. Notes on paper are trapped there. They cannot be searched.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s a new player on the block called Notion. <a href="https://www.notion.so" class="fw700" target="_blank">You can find it here.</a></p>

<p>Give it a spin. Tell me how it goes.</p>
