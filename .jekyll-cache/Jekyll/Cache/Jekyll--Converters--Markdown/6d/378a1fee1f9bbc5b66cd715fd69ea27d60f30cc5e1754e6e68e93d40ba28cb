<h3 id="your-college-login">Your College Login</h3>

<p>You‚Äôll need to obtain your college login info. To do so, go to <a href="https://acsis.algonquincollege.com" title="Log in to your college ACSIS account.">Student Information System</a> (ACSIS). Click on Network, then follow the instructions to change your temporary password to a new unique password.</p>

<h3 id="wi-fi">Wi-Fi</h3>

<p>Join the ACGuest Wi-Fi network. We‚Äôll want to disconnect from it as soon as you have your official login credentials.</p>

<p>Go to <a href="https://acsis.algonquincollege.com" target="_blank" title="ACSIS">ACSIS</a>. There are login instructions on the front page. Once you‚Äôre in, click to Network Account Info in the left navigation. You‚Äôll retrieve your login credentials there.</p>

<p>Once you have your credentials, you‚Äôll be able to join the ACSecure Wi-Fi network.</p>

<p>Make sure you delete the ACGuest network from your settings. To do so,</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the Ô£ø menu and click on System Preferences</li>
  <li>Click on Network, then click on Wi-Fi in the left pane</li>
  <li>Click on Advanced.</li>
  <li>Find ACGuest in the list of networks.</li>
  <li>Hit the ‚Äî button to delete it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Don‚Äôt allow your computer to connect to the ACGuest network again. It‚Äôs just annoying.</p>

<h3 id="loaner-laptops">Loaner Laptops</h3>

<p>All students in the Graphic Design Program have access to a loaner MacBook Pro in the event that their computer requires repairs. This is what the College requires:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A loaner MacBook Pro can be borrowed from Student Central, at the lower level of C Building for a 2 week period. In certain circumstances the loan can be renewed for up to 30 days. You will need to provide your student ID. If you are having your laptop repaired elsewhere, be sure to bring your repair documentation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You‚Äôll get a MacBook Pro. All you‚Äôll need to do is <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/creative-cloud-desktop-app-download.html" title="Download the Adobe Desktop App." target="_blank">install the Adobe Desktop App</a>, log in, then install the apps you need. There‚Äôs no reason for not finishing your work.</p>
