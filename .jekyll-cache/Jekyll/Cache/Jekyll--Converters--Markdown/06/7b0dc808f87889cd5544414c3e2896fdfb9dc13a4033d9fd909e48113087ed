<h3 id="attendance">Attendance</h3>

<p>This is not a correspondence course. In order to earn points for in-class assignments, students must be present in class. In the case of an un-excused absence, students can complete the assignment with the help of the online course material, but no points will be earned. Feedback will, however be provided on the studentâ€™s performance. If an absence is unavoidable, please communicate with faculty before the class to make them aware of it. Faculty will have the option to excuse your absence and allow completion of the assignment outside of class.</p>

<p>Last semester, you created a Semester 1 folder. It has all of your work in it. You should offload that onto a USB key for safe keeping. Itâ€™s even a good idea to put it on two USB keys. Keep each at a different place, so you donâ€™t lose them.</p>
