  ### Your Tech Support Team

  If you need software or hardware support, you can always contact me via <a href="mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com" title="E-Mail Alain Paradis">e-mail</a>. You should be able to resolve most common support issues by referring to [our FreshDesk site](http://algonquincollege.freshdesk.com) We also have two excellent tech support people who are there to help you. They are:

  Brad St-Jean <a href="mailto:stjeanb@algonquincollege.com" title="E-Mail Brad St-Jean">E-mail</a>

  Mike Stacey <a href="mailto:staceym@algonquincollege.com" title="E-Mail Mike Stacey">E-mail</a>

  **Their offices are at N208E**. That's just down the hall, near the water fountain.

  ### Your College Login

  You'll need to obtain your college login info. To do so, go to <a href="https://acsis.algonquincollege.com" title="Log in to your college ACSIS account.">Student Information System</a> (ACSIS). Click on Network, then follow the instructions to change your temporary password to a new unique password.

  ### Wi-Fi

  Join the ACGuest Wi-Fi network. We'll want to disconnect from it as soon as you have your official login credentials.

  Go to <a href="https://acsis.algonquincollege.com" target="_blank" title="ACSIS">ACSIS</a>. There are login instructions on the front page. Once you're in, click to Network Account Info in the left navigation. You'll retrieve your login credentials there.

  Once you have your credentials, you'll be able to join the ACSecure Wi-Fi network.

  Make sure you delete the ACGuest network from your settings. To do so,

  1. Go to the &#xF8FF; menu and click on System Preferences
  2. Click on Network, then click on Wi-Fi in the left pane
  3. Click on Advanced.
  4. Find ACGuest in the list of networks.
  5. Hit the â€” button to delete it.


  Don't allow your computer to connect to the ACGuest network again. It's just annoying.

  ### E-Mail Forwarding

  It's crucial that you receive messages sent to your College e-mail address in a timely fashion. The best solution is likely to forward your college e-mail messages to your personal address. To do so, log in to your account at <a href="http://liveac.algonquincollege.com/" title="Log in to your college e-mail account." target="_blank">liveac.algonquincollege.com</a>.

  <img class="size100" alt="forward-college-e-mail" src="/images/setup-college-services/forward-college-e-mail.jpg">

  Find the Forwarding settings. Enter your personal e-mail address, then save your settings.

  ### Other Important Services

  * Get <a href="https://algonquincollege.libguides.com/LinkedIn-Learning/" title="Get LinkedIn Learning" target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning from here</a>.

  Before you install Adobe software, you'll want to uninstall previous versions. I'll give you instructions one-on-one in class. I want you to have only the latest software on your computer, and no older versions.

  ### Connect to Our File Server

  To connect to the Graphic Design file server, [follow these instructions](http://algonquincollege.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/11000009593-how-to-connect-to-the-college-dropbox-server-from-your-mac "Connect to the Graphic Design file server").

  ### College Printer Setup

  You'll setup the school printers on your laptop so you can print in the classrooms, the Agency and the Print Shop. <a href="http://algonquincollege.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/11000037912-how-to-install-student-printers-on-your-mac" title="Set up your Mac for printing in our classrooms." target="_blank">Go to this page for instructions</a> on how to set up printing

  ### Adobe Creative Cloud Setup

  As a student in a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) program, you are entitled to a vast array of resources, including Adobe Creative Cloud software. You will receive a message at your <a href="https://liveac.algonquincollege.com" title="Check your college e-mail for instructions on setting up Adobe Apps." target="_blank">college e-mail account</a> with a link and instructions.

  Now that you have all this great software, you can use <a href="https://algonquincollege.libguides.com/LinkedIn-Learning/" title="Sign Into LinkedIn Learning" target="_blank">LinkedIn Learning</a> to access software tutorials beyond those I post on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/accomputergraphics" title="Visit my YouTube Channel" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a>.

  Creative Cloud is a large suite of creative applications and services offered by Adobe. We'll be principally using Illustrator, Photoshop and InDesign. They're installed through the Creative Cloud desktop app. You should also run updates with the app from your menu bar.

  <img class="size33" alt="creative-cloud-setup" src="/images/mac-setup/creative-cloud-setup.jpg">

  <a href="https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/" title="Adobe Fonts: All the fonts you'll ever need." target="_blank">Adobe Fonts</a> is a cloud service which offers a large number of fonts. Creative Cloud also allows us to store files and libraries of artwork on their servers to sync them between computers or users.

  Once you're done, you should have the Adobe Desktop App installed, along with Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign and Acrobat.

  ### Loaner Laptops

  All students in the Graphic Design Program have access to a loaner MacBook Pro in the event that their computer requires repairs. This is what the College requires:

  > A loaner MacBook Pro can be borrowed from Student Central, at the lower level of C Building for a 2 week period. In certain circumstances the loan can be renewed for up to 30 days. You will need to provide your student ID. If you are having your laptop repaired elsewhere, be sure to bring your repair documentation.

  You'll get a MacBook Pro. All you'll need to do is <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/creative-cloud/kb/creative-cloud-desktop-app-download.html" title="Download the Adobe Desktop App." target="_blank">install the Adobe Desktop App</a>, log in, then install the apps you need. There's no reason for not finishing your work.
