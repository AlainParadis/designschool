  <div class="attentionbox tip">
    This setup needs to be done while on campus, not from home.
  </div>

  The instructions below show you how to install the Print Shop printer drivers on your Mac. This saves you from having to wait in line for walk-in computers. This setup process only needs to be completed once.

  The Algonquin College Print Shop is located at the back of the Connections Store in H building. You can get there through the cafeteria or through the Student Commmons building.
