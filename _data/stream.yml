    coursecode: DSN1562
    instructor: Alain Paradis
    description: |
      The field of computer graphics consists of page layout, illustration and photo manipulation. Page layout is the hub for illustrations and photographs. Purpose-built instructional web pages, in-class and video tutorials guide students through the process of building electronic documents in Adobe InDesign, containing images edited in Photoshop and custom digital illustrations created in Adobe Illustrator. Activities include learning common technology-related terminology, organizing graphics files and fonts, illustrating digitally and editing photographs which they integrate into page designs.
