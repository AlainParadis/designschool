description: "The baseline grid represents the leading for body text in a document. You can use multiples of this leading value for all elements of the page to ensure that text always lines up between columns and from page to page."

  Aligning the text to the baseline is a common practice for multi-column page designs, like magazines. It makes the text baselines align across columns. So, if you put a ruler on the page at the baseline, they would all line up across columns. This makes for a much cleaner look.

  You need to know your leading size to start with. Go to <span class="command">Preferences > Grids</span>, then change the <span class="command">Increment Every</span> number to match your leading value. Once that's done, go to <span class="command">Indents and Spacing</span> in your paragraph style. Set <span class="command">Align to Grid</span> to <span class="command">All Lines</span>.
