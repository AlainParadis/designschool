description: "When designing long documents, you'll often need to set up footnotes. They have a superscript number in the text which refers to a number at the bottom of the page. InDesign takes care of most of the setup for you."
details: |

  > A footnote consists of two linked parts: the footnote reference number that appears in text, and the footnote text that appears at the bottom of the column. You can create footnotes or import them from Word or RTF documents. Footnotes are automatically numbered as they are added to a document. Numbering restarts in each story. You can control the numbering style, appearance, and layout of footnotes." <cite>Source: <a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/indesign/using/footnotes.html" title="Adobe Support: InDesign Footnotes" target="_blank">Adobe Support</a></cite>
