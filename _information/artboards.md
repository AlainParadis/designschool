details: |
  At first glance, Artboards seem to be pages. They're actually more than that. They're containers for artwork in Illustrator. They're more versatile than a simple page. It's possible to do fun stuff like have difference size Artboards and even nest one Artboard in another. We'll explore the possibilities.

  Artboards have a tool and a panel. You get the tool by typing <span class="command">shift-O</span>. Make sure you always name your artboards in the panel by double-clicking on their names, as you would a layer in Photoshop.

  You also have the Options Bar at your disposal while you use the Artboard tool.

  ### Organizing Artboards

  Once you're using the Artboard tool, you can create artboards by dragging as you would with the rectangle tool. As an example, you can create artboards for a company. They could include:

  * Business card
  * Magazine advertisement
  * #10 business envelope
  * Logo
  * All-encompassing artboard

  Note the *all-encompassing artboard*. It's a big artboard around all the others. This allows us to print or export that artboard.

  ## Artboard Options

  If you double-click on the icon in the Artboards panel, you get the options for that artboard. You can edit their sizes, change their orientation and much more.

  ## Save as or Print

  In the image above, the PDF would only contain the all-encompassing artboard with all the others within it.

  The same goes with printing. You can print individual or a range of artboards.
assignment: |
  Create artboards as directed in the provided file. Make sure you accurately create your artboards at the indicated dimensions. The *All-encompassing artboard* needs to wrap around the other artboards with a small margin.

  The *Half-letter* artboard is half of a letter page, so it's 5.5" wide by 8.5" tall.

  Name all artboards in the Artboards panel.
