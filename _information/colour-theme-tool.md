description: "The Colour Theme tool is a hidden gem in InDesign. It can sample colour and even apply colour. It can magically pull a whole colour theme from a photo for you to use in your designs. Let's try it out!"

  InDesign's Eye Dropper tool has a lot of power packed into a seemingly trivial tool.

  ### Basic Functionality

  <div class="attentionbox shortcut">To switch to the Eye Dropper, first hit Escape to ensure your cursor is not in a text frame. Now it's safe to hit i.</div>

  The Eye Dropper tool in InDesign is quite unique. It can actually apply colour. Use it to click on a colour. You'll notice that the tool icon flips over. That's the

      Sample with the tool on the left. Apply the sample with the tool on the right.

  Note that InDesign's Eye Dropper is not a pixel-based tool. To prove it, sample a gradient. It will not sample the spot where you clicked, like Photoshop would do. It works like Illustrator does. It will sample the whole gradient.

  ### Beyond the Basics

  To go beyond the tool's basic capabilities, you can change its settings. Double-click on the Eye Dropper to open its settings dialogue. You can see that it can sample much more than just colours.

  ### Sample Text Styling

  The Eye Dropper allows you to sample text styling.

  ### Colour Theme Tool

  The Colour Theme tool is where the magic really happens. It allows you to click at one spot on a photo to create a series of swatches based on the colours in that photo.

  Notice that when you 

  * We can cover sampling paragraph styles.
  * Set up what the eye dropper samples and what it doesn't.
  * What does it mean when the Eye Dropper tool shifts from the left to the right? When it's full vs empty?
